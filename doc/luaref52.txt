1.  Introduction                                                  *lua52-sec1*
==============================================================================

Lua is an extension programming language designed to support general
procedural programming with data description facilities. It also offers good
support for object-oriented programming, functional programming, and
data-driven programming. Lua is intended to be used as a powerful,
lightweight, embeddable scripting language for any program that needs one. Lua
is implemented as a library, written in clean C, the common subset of Standard
C and C++.
Being an extension language, Lua has no notion of a "main" program: it only
works embedded in a host client, called the embedding program or simply the
host. The host program can invoke functions to execute a piece of Lua code,
can write and read Lua variables, and can register C functions to be called by
Lua code. Through the use of C functions, Lua can be augmented to cope with a
wide range of different domains, thus creating customized programming
languages sharing a syntactical framework. The Lua distribution includes a
sample host program called lua, which uses the Lua library to offer a
complete, standalone Lua interpreter, for interactive or batch use.
Lua is free software, and is provided as usual with no guarantees, as stated
in its license. The implementation described in this manual is available at
Lua's official web site, www.lua.org.
Like any other reference manual, this document is dry in places. For a
discussion of the decisions behind the design of Lua, see the technical papers
available at Lua's web site. For a detailed introduction to programming in
Lua, see Roberto's book, Programming in Lua.

2.  Basic Concepts                                                *lua52-sec2*
==============================================================================

This section describes the basic concepts of the language.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1  Values and Types                                           *lua52-sec2.1*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua is a dynamically typed language. This means that variables do not have
types; only values do. There are no type definitions in the language. All
values carry their own type.
All values in Lua are first-class values. This means that all values can be
stored in variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as
results.
There are eight basic types in Lua: nil, boolean, number, string, function,
userdata, thread, and table. Nil is the type of the value nil, whose main
property is to be different from any other value; it usually represents the
absence of a useful value. Boolean is the type of the values false and true.
Both nil and false make a condition false; any other value makes it true.
Number represents real (double-precision floating-point) numbers. Operations
on numbers follow the same rules of the underlying C implementation, which, in
turn, usually follows the IEEE 754 standard. (It is easy to build Lua
interpreters that use other internal representations for numbers, such as
single-precision floats or long integers; see file luaconf.h.) String
represents immutable sequences of bytes. Lua is 8-bit clean: strings can
contain any 8-bit value, including embedded zeros ('\0').
Lua can call (and manipulate) functions written in Lua and functions written
in C (see |lua52-sec3.4.9|).
The type userdata is provided to allow arbitrary C data to be stored in Lua
variables. A userdata value is a pointer to a block of raw memory. There are
two kinds of userdata: full userdata, where the block of memory is managed by
Lua, and light userdata, where the block of memory is managed by the host.
Userdata has no predefined operations in Lua, except assignment and identity
test. By using metatables, the programmer can define operations for full
userdata values (see |lua52-sec2.4|). Userdata values cannot be created or
modified in Lua, only through the C API. This guarantees the integrity of data
owned by the host program.
The type thread represents independent threads of execution and it is used to
implement coroutines (see |lua52-sec2.6|). Do not confuse Lua threads with
operating-system threads. Lua supports coroutines on all systems, even those
that do not support threads.
The type table implements associative arrays, that is, arrays that can be
indexed not only with numbers, but with any Lua value except nil and NaN (Not
a Number, a special numeric value used to represent undefined or
unrepresentable results, such as 0/0). Tables can be heterogeneous; that is,
they can contain values of all types (except nil). Any key with value nil is
not considered part of the table. Conversely, any key that is not part of a
table has an associated value nil.
Tables are the sole data structuring mechanism in Lua; they can be used to
represent ordinary arrays, sequences, symbol tables, sets, records, graphs,
trees, etc. To represent records, Lua uses the field name as an index. The
language supports this representation by providing a.name as syntactic sugar
for a["name"]. There are several convenient ways to create tables in Lua (see
|lua52-sec3.4.8|).
We use the term sequence to denote a table where the set of all positive
numeric keys is equal to {1..n} for some integer n, which is called the length
of the sequence (see |lua52-sec3.4.6|).
Like indices, the values of table fields can be of any type. In particular,
because functions are first-class values, table fields can contain functions.
Thus tables can also carry methods (see |lua52-sec3.4.10|).
The indexing of tables follows the definition of raw equality in the language.
The expressions a[i] and a[j] denote the same table element if and only if i
and j are raw equal (that is, equal without metamethods).
Tables, functions, threads, and (full) userdata values are objects: variables
do not actually contain these values, only references to them. Assignment,
parameter passing, and function returns always manipulate references to such
values; these operations do not imply any kind of copy.
The library function |lua52-type| returns a string describing the type of a
given value (see |lua52-sec6.1|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2  Environments and the Global Environment                    *lua52-sec2.2*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As will be discussed in |lua52-sec3.2| and |lua52-sec3.3.3|, any reference to
a global name var is syntactically translated to _ENV.var. Moreover, every
chunk is compiled in the scope of an external local variable called _ENV (see
|lua52-sec3.3.2|), so _ENV itself is never a global name in a chunk.
Despite the existence of this external _ENV variable and the translation of
global names, _ENV is a completely regular name. In particular, you can define
new variables and parameters with that name. Each reference to a global name
uses the _ENV that is visible at that point in the program, following the
usual visibility rules of Lua (see |lua52-sec3.5|).
Any table used as the value of _ENV is called an environment.
Lua keeps a distinguished environment called the global environment. This
value is kept at a special index in the C registry (see |lua52-sec4.5|). In
Lua, the variable |lua52-_G| is initialized with this same value.
When Lua compiles a chunk, it initializes the value of its _ENV upvalue with
the global environment (see |lua52-load|). Therefore, by default, global
variables in Lua code refer to entries in the global environment. Moreover,
all standard libraries are loaded in the global environment and several
functions there operate on that environment. You can use |lua52-load| (or
|lua52-loadfile|) to load a chunk with a different environment. (In C, you
have to load the chunk and then change the value of its first upvalue.)
If you change the global environment in the registry (through C code or the
debug library), all chunks loaded after the change will get the new
environment. Previously loaded chunks are not affected, however, as each has
its own reference to the environment in its _ENV variable. Moreover, the
variable |lua52-_G| (which is stored in the original global environment) is
never updated by Lua.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3  Error Handling                                             *lua52-sec2.3*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because Lua is an embedded extension language, all Lua actions start from C
code in the host program calling a function from the Lua library (see
|lua52-lua_pcall|). Whenever an error occurs during the compilation or
execution of a Lua chunk, control returns to the host, which can take
appropriate measures (such as printing an error message).
Lua code can explicitly generate an error by calling the |lua52-error|
function. If you need to catch errors in Lua, you can use |lua52-pcall| or
|lua52-xpcall| to call a given function in protected mode.
Whenever there is an error, an error object (also called an error message) is
propagated with information about the error. Lua itself only generates errors
where the error object is a string, but programs may generate errors with any
value for the error object.
When you use |lua52-xpcall| or |lua52-lua_pcall|, you may give a message
handler to be called in case of errors. This function is called with the
original error message and returns a new error message. It is called before
the error unwinds the stack, so that it can gather more information about the
error, for instance by inspecting the stack and creating a stack traceback.
This message handler is still protected by the protected call; so, an error
inside the message handler will call the message handler again. If this loop
goes on, Lua breaks it and returns an appropriate message.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.4  Metatables and Metamethods                                 *lua52-sec2.4*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every value in Lua can have a metatable. This metatable is an ordinary Lua
table that defines the behavior of the original value under certain special
operations. You can change several aspects of the behavior of operations over
a value by setting specific fields in its metatable. For instance, when a
non-numeric value is the operand of an addition, Lua checks for a function in
the field "__add" of the value's metatable. If it finds one, Lua calls this
function to perform the addition.
The keys in a metatable are derived from the event names; the corresponding
values are called metamethods. In the previous example, the event is "add" and
the metamethod is the function that performs the addition.
You can query the metatable of any value using the |lua52-getmetatable|
function.
You can replace the metatable of tables using the |lua52-setmetatable|
function. You cannot change the metatable of other types from Lua (except by
using the debug library); you must use the C API for that.
Tables and full userdata have individual metatables (although multiple tables
and userdata can share their metatables). Values of all other types share one
single metatable per type; that is, there is one single metatable for all
numbers, one for all strings, etc. By default, a value has no metatable, but
the string library sets a metatable for the string type (see |lua52-sec6.4|).
A metatable controls how an object behaves in arithmetic operations, order
comparisons, concatenation, length operation, and indexing. A metatable also
can define a function to be called when a userdata or a table is garbage
collected. When Lua performs one of these operations over a value, it checks
whether this value has a metatable with the corresponding event. If so, the
value associated with that key (the metamethod) controls how Lua will perform
the operation.
Metatables control the operations listed next. Each operation is identified by
its corresponding name. The key for each operation is a string with its name
prefixed by two underscores, '__'; for instance, the key for operation "add"
is the string "__add".
The semantics of these operations is better explained by a Lua function
describing how the interpreter executes the operation. The code shown here in
Lua is only illustrative; the real behavior is hard coded in the interpreter
and it is much more efficient than this simulation. All functions used in
these descriptions (|lua52-rawget|, |lua52-tonumber|, etc.) are described in
|lua52-sec6.1|. In particular, to retrieve the metamethod of a given object,
we use the expression
>
     metatable(obj)[event]
<
This should be read as
>
     rawget(getmetatable(obj) or {}, event)
<
This means that the access to a metamethod does not invoke other metamethods,
and access to objects with no metatables does not fail (it simply results in
nil).
For the unary - and # operators, the metamethod is called with a dummy second
argument. This extra argument is only to simplify Lua's internals; it may be
removed in future versions and therefore it is not present in the following
code. (For most uses this extra argument is irrelevant.)
- "add": the + operation.
  The function getbinhandler below defines how Lua chooses a handler for a
  binary operation. First, Lua tries the first operand. If its type does not
  define a handler for the operation, then Lua tries the second operand.
>
       function getbinhandler (op1, op2, event)
         return metatable(op1)[event] or metatable(op2)[event]
       end
<
  By using this function, the behavior of the op1 + op2 is
>
       function add_event (op1, op2)
         local o1, o2 = tonumber(op1), tonumber(op2)
         if o1 and o2 then  -- both operands are numeric?
           return o1 + o2   -- '+' here is the primitive 'add'
         else  -- at least one of the operands is not numeric
           local h = getbinhandler(op1, op2, "__add")
           if h then
             -- call the handler with both operands
             return (h(op1, op2))
           else  -- no handler available: default behavior
             error(...)
           end
         end
       end
<
- "sub": the - operation. Behavior similar to the "add" operation.
- "mul": the * operation. Behavior similar to the "add" operation.
- "div": the / operation. Behavior similar to the "add" operation.
- "mod": the % operation. Behavior similar to the "add" operation, with the
  operation o1 - floor(o1/o2)*o2 as the primitive operation.
- "pow": the ^ (exponentiation) operation. Behavior similar to the "add"
  operation, with the function pow (from the C math library) as the primitive
  operation.
- "unm": the unary - operation.
>
       function unm_event (op)
         local o = tonumber(op)
         if o then  -- operand is numeric?
           return -o  -- '-' here is the primitive 'unm'
         else  -- the operand is not numeric.
           -- Try to get a handler from the operand
           local h = metatable(op).__unm
           if h then
             -- call the handler with the operand
             return (h(op))
           else  -- no handler available: default behavior
             error(...)
           end
         end
       end
<
- "concat": the .. (concatenation) operation.

2.5  Garbage Collection                                         *lua52-sec2.5*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua performs automatic memory management. This means that you have to worry
neither about allocating memory for new objects nor about freeing it when the
objects are no longer needed. Lua manages memory automatically by running a
garbage collector to collect all dead objects (that is, objects that are no
longer accessible from Lua). All memory used by Lua is subject to automatic
management: strings, tables, userdata, functions, threads, internal
structures, etc.
Lua implements an incremental mark-and-sweep collector. It uses two numbers to
control its garbage-collection cycles: the garbage-collector pause and the
garbage-collector step multiplier. Both use percentage points as units (e.g.,
a value of 100 means an internal value of 1).
The garbage-collector pause controls how long the collector waits before
starting a new cycle. Larger values make the collector less aggressive. Values
smaller than 100 mean the collector will not wait to start a new cycle. A
value of 200 means that the collector waits for the total memory in use to
double before starting a new cycle.
The garbage-collector step multiplier controls the relative speed of the
collector relative to memory allocation. Larger values make the collector more
aggressive but also increase the size of each incremental step. Values smaller
than 100 make the collector too slow and can result in the collector never
finishing a cycle. The default is 200, which means that the collector runs at
"twice" the speed of memory allocation.
If you set the step multiplier to a very large number (larger than 10% of the
maximum number of bytes that the program may use), the collector behaves like
a stop-the-world collector. If you then set the pause to 200, the collector
behaves as in old Lua versions, doing a complete collection every time Lua
doubles its memory usage.
You can change these numbers by calling |lua52-lua_gc| in C or
|lua52-collectgarbage| in Lua. You can also use these functions to control the
collector directly (e.g., stop and restart it).
As an experimental feature in Lua 5.2, you can change the collector's
operation mode from incremental to generational. A generational collector
assumes that most objects die young, and therefore it traverses only young
(recently created) objects. This behavior can reduce the time used by the
collector, but also increases memory usage (as old dead objects may
accumulate). To mitigate this second problem, from time to time the
generational collector performs a full collection. Remember that this is an
experimental feature; you are welcome to try it, but check your gains.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.5.1  Garbage                                                *lua52-sec2.5.1*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can set garbage-collector metamethods for tables and, using the C API, for
full userdata (see |lua52-sec2.4|). These metamethods are also called
finalizers. Finalizers allow you to coordinate Lua's garbage collection with
external resource management (such as closing files, network or database
connections, or freeing your own memory).
For an object (table or userdata) to be finalized when collected, you must
mark it for finalization. You mark an object for finalization when you set its
metatable and the metatable has a field indexed by the string "__gc". Note
that if you set a metatable without a __gc field and later create that field
in the metatable, the object will not be marked for finalization. However,
after an object is marked, you can freely change the __gc field of its
metatable.
When a marked object becomes garbage, it is not collected immediately by the
garbage collector. Instead, Lua puts it in a list. After the collection, Lua
does the equivalent of the following function for each object in that list:
>
     function gc_event (obj)
       local h = metatable(obj).__gc
       if type(h) == "function" then
         h(obj)
       end
     end
<
At the end of each garbage-collection cycle, the finalizers for objects are
called in the reverse order that they were marked for collection, among those
collected in that cycle; that is, the first finalizer to be called is the one
associated with the object marked last in the program. The execution of each
finalizer may occur at any point during the execution of the regular code.
Because the object being collected must still be used by the finalizer, it
(and other objects accessible only through it) must be resurrected by Lua.
Usually, this resurrection is transient, and the object memory is freed in the
next garbage-collection cycle. However, if the finalizer stores the object in
some global place (e.g., a global variable), then there is a permanent
resurrection. In any case, the object memory is freed only when it becomes
completely inaccessible; its finalizer will never be called twice.
When you close a state (see |lua52-lua_close|), Lua calls the finalizers of
all objects marked for finalization, following the reverse order that they
were marked. If any finalizer marks new objects for collection during that
phase, these new objects will not be finalized.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.5.2  Weak Tables                                            *lua52-sec2.5.2*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A weak table is a table whose elements are weak references. A weak reference
is ignored by the garbage collector. In other words, if the only references to
an object are weak references, then the garbage collector will collect that
object.
A weak table can have weak keys, weak values, or both. A table with weak keys
allows the collection of its keys, but prevents the collection of its values.
A table with both weak keys and weak values allows the collection of both keys
and values. In any case, if either the key or the value is collected, the
whole pair is removed from the table. The weakness of a table is controlled by
the __mode field of its metatable. If the __mode field is a string containing
the character 'k', the keys in the table are weak. If __mode contains 'v', the
values in the table are weak.
A table with weak keys and strong values is also called an ephemeron table. In
an ephemeron table, a value is considered reachable only if its key is
reachable. In particular, if the only reference to a key comes through its
value, the pair is removed.
Any change in the weakness of a table may take effect only at the next collect
cycle. In particular, if you change the weakness to a stronger mode, Lua may
still collect some items from that table before the change takes effect.
Only objects that have an explicit construction are removed from weak tables.
Values, such as numbers and light C functions, are not subject to garbage
collection, and therefore are not removed from weak tables (unless its
associated value is collected). Although strings are subject to garbage
collection, they do not have an explicit construction, and therefore are not
removed from weak tables.
Resurrected objects (that is, objects being finalized and objects accessible
only through objects being finalized) have a special behavior in weak tables.
They are removed from weak values before running their finalizers, but are
removed from weak keys only in the next collection after running their
finalizers, when such objects are actually freed. This behavior allows the
finalizer to access properties associated with the object through weak tables.
If a weak table is among the resurrected objects in a collection cycle, it may
not be properly cleared until the next cycle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.6  Coroutines                                                 *lua52-sec2.6*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua supports coroutines, also called collaborative multithreading. A coroutine
in Lua represents an independent thread of execution. Unlike threads in
multithread systems, however, a coroutine only suspends its execution by
explicitly calling a yield function.
You create a coroutine by calling |lua52-coroutine.create|. Its sole argument
is a function that is the main function of the coroutine. The create function
only creates a new coroutine and returns a handle to it (an object of type
thread); it does not start the coroutine.
You execute a coroutine by calling |lua52-coroutine.resume|. When you first
call |lua52-coroutine.resume|, passing as its first argument a thread returned
by |lua52-coroutine.create|, the coroutine starts its execution, at the first
line of its main function. Extra arguments passed to |lua52-coroutine.resume|
are passed on to the coroutine main function. After the coroutine starts
running, it runs until it terminates or yields.
A coroutine can terminate its execution in two ways: normally, when its main
function returns (explicitly or implicitly, after the last instruction); and
abnormally, if there is an unprotected error. In the first case,
|lua52-coroutine.resume| returns true, plus any values returned by the
coroutine main function. In case of errors, |lua52-coroutine.resume| returns
false plus an error message.
A coroutine yields by calling |lua52-coroutine.yield|. When a coroutine
yields, the corresponding |lua52-coroutine.resume| returns immediately, even
if the yield happens inside nested function calls (that is, not in the main
function, but in a function directly or indirectly called by the main
function). In the case of a yield, |lua52-coroutine.resume| also returns true,
plus any values passed to |lua52-coroutine.yield|. The next time you resume
the same coroutine, it continues its execution from the point where it
yielded, with the call to |lua52-coroutine.yield| returning any extra
arguments passed to |lua52-coroutine.resume|.
Like |lua52-coroutine.create|, the |lua52-coroutine.wrap| function also
creates a coroutine, but instead of returning the coroutine itself, it returns
a function that, when called, resumes the coroutine. Any arguments passed to
this function go as extra arguments to |lua52-coroutine.resume|.
|lua52-coroutine.wrap| returns all the values returned by
|lua52-coroutine.resume|, except the first one (the boolean error code).
Unlike |lua52-coroutine.resume|, |lua52-coroutine.wrap| does not catch errors;
any error is propagated to the caller.
As an example of how coroutines work, consider the following code:
>
     function foo (a)
       print("foo", a)
       return coroutine.yield(2*a)
     end
     
     co = coroutine.create(function (a,b)
           print("co-body", a, b)
           local r = foo(a+1)
           print("co-body", r)
           local r, s = coroutine.yield(a+b, a-b)
           print("co-body", r, s)
           return b, "end"
     end)
     
     print("main", coroutine.resume(co, 1, 10))
     print("main", coroutine.resume(co, "r"))
     print("main", coroutine.resume(co, "x", "y"))
     print("main", coroutine.resume(co, "x", "y"))
<
When you run it, it produces the following output:
>
     co-body 1       10
     foo     2
     main    true    4
     co-body r
     main    true    11      -9
     co-body x       y
     main    true    10      end
     main    false   cannot resume dead coroutine
<
You can also create and manipulate coroutines through the C API: see functions
|lua52-lua_newthread|, |lua52-lua_resume|, and |lua52-lua_yield|.

3.  The Language                                                  *lua52-sec3*
==============================================================================

This section describes the lexis, the syntax, and the semantics of Lua. In
other words, this section describes which tokens are valid, how they can be
combined, and what their combinations mean.
Language constructs will be explained using the usual extended BNF notation,
in which {a} means 0 or more a's, and [a] means an optional a. Non-terminals
are shown like non-terminal, keywords are shown like kword, and other terminal
symbols are shown like '='. The complete syntax of Lua can be found in
|lua52-sec9| at the end of this manual.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1  Lexical Conventions                                        *lua52-sec3.1*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua is a free-form language. It ignores spaces (including new lines) and
comments between lexical elements (tokens), except as delimiters between names
and keywords.
Names (also called identifiers) in Lua can be any string of letters, digits,
and underscores, not beginning with a digit. Identifiers are used to name
variables, table fields, and labels.
The following keywords are reserved and cannot be used as names:
>
     and       break     do        else      elseif    end
     false     for       function  goto      if        in
     local     nil       not       or        repeat    return
     then      true      until     while
<
Lua is a case-sensitive language: and is a reserved word, but And and AND are
two different, valid names. As a convention, names starting with an underscore
followed by uppercase letters (such as |lua52-_VERSION|) are reserved for
variables used by Lua.
The following strings denote other tokens:
>
     +     -     *     /     %     ^     #
     ==    ~=    <=    >=    <     >     =
     (     )     {     }     [     ]     ::
     ;     :     ,     .     ..    ...
<
Literal strings can be delimited by matching single or double quotes, and can
contain the following C-like escape sequences: '\a' (bell), '\b' (backspace),
'\f' (form feed), '\n' (newline), '\r' (carriage return), '\t' (horizontal
tab), '\v' (vertical tab), '\\' (backslash), '\"' (quotation mark [double
quote]), and '\'' (apostrophe [single quote]). A backslash followed by a real
newline results in a newline in the string. The escape sequence '\z' skips the
following span of white-space characters, including line breaks; it is
particularly useful to break and indent a long literal string into multiple
lines without adding the newlines and spaces into the string contents.
A byte in a literal string can also be specified by its numerical value. This
can be done with the escape sequence \xXX, where XX is a sequence of exactly
two hexadecimal digits, or with the escape sequence \ddd, where ddd is a
sequence of up to three decimal digits. (Note that if a decimal escape is to
be followed by a digit, it must be expressed using exactly three digits.)
Strings in Lua can contain any 8-bit value, including embedded zeros, which
can be specified as '\0'.
Literal strings can also be defined using a long format enclosed by long
brackets. We define an opening long bracket of level n as an opening square
bracket followed by n equal signs followed by another opening square bracket.
So, an opening long bracket of level 0 is written as [[, an opening long
bracket of level 1 is written as [=[, and so on. A closing long bracket is
defined similarly; for instance, a closing long bracket of level 4 is written
as ]====]. A long literal starts with an opening long bracket of any level and
ends at the first closing long bracket of the same level. It can contain any
text except a closing bracket of the proper level. Literals in this bracketed
form can run for several lines, do not interpret any escape sequences, and
ignore long brackets of any other level. Any kind of end-of-line sequence
(carriage return, newline, carriage return followed by newline, or newline
followed by carriage return) is converted to a simple newline.
Any byte in a literal string not explicitly affected by the previous rules
represents itself. However, Lua opens files for parsing in text mode, and the
system file functions may have problems with some control characters. So, it
is safer to represent non-text data as a quoted literal with explicit escape
sequences for non-text characters.
For convenience, when the opening long bracket is immediately followed by a
newline, the newline is not included in the string. As an example, in a system
using ASCII (in which 'a' is coded as 97, newline is coded as 10, and '1' is
coded as 49), the five literal strings below denote the same string:
>
     a = 'alo\n123"'
     a = "alo\n123\""
     a = '\97lo\10\04923"'
     a = [[alo
     123"]]
     a = [==[
     alo
     123"]==]
<
A numerical constant can be written with an optional fractional part and an
optional decimal exponent, marked by a letter 'e' or 'E'. Lua also accepts
hexadecimal constants, which start with 0x or 0X. Hexadecimal constants also
accept an optional fractional part plus an optional binary exponent, marked by
a letter 'p' or 'P'. Examples of valid numerical constants are
>
     3     3.0     3.1416     314.16e-2     0.31416E1
     0xff  0x0.1E  0xA23p-4   0X1.921FB54442D18P+1
<
A comment starts with a double hyphen (--) anywhere outside a string. If the
text immediately after -- is not an opening long bracket, the comment is a
short comment, which runs until the end of the line. Otherwise, it is a long
comment, which runs until the corresponding closing long bracket. Long
comments are frequently used to disable code temporarily.

3.2  Variables                                                  *lua52-sec3.2*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Variables are places that store values. There are three kinds of variables in
Lua: global variables, local variables, and table fields.
A single name can denote a global variable or a local variable (or a
function's formal parameter, which is a particular kind of local variable):
>
	var ::= Name
<
Name denotes identifiers, as defined in |lua52-sec3.1|.
Any variable name is assumed to be global unless explicitly declared as a
local (see |lua52-sec3.3.7|). Local variables are lexically scoped: local
variables can be freely accessed by functions defined inside their scope (see
|lua52-sec3.5|).
Before the first assignment to a variable, its value is nil.
Square brackets are used to index a table:
>
	var ::= prefixexp '[' exp ']'
<
The meaning of accesses to table fields can be changed via metatables. An
access to an indexed variable t[i] is equivalent to a call
gettable_event(t,i). (See |lua52-sec2.4| for a complete description of the
gettable_event function. This function is not defined or callable in Lua. We
use it here only for explanatory purposes.)
The syntax var.Name is just syntactic sugar for var["Name"]:
>
	var ::= prefixexp '.' Name
<
An access to a global variable x is equivalent to _ENV.x. Due to the way that
chunks are compiled, _ENV is never a global name (see |lua52-sec2.2|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3  Statements                                                 *lua52-sec3.3*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua supports an almost conventional set of statements, similar to those in
Pascal or C. This set includes assignments, control structures, function
calls, and variable declarations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3.1  Blocks                                                 *lua52-sec3.3.1*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A block is a list of statements, which are executed sequentially:
>
	block ::= {stat}
<
Lua has empty statements that allow you to separate statements with
semicolons, start a block with a semicolon or write two semicolons in
sequence:
>
	stat ::= ';'
<
Function calls and assignments can start with an open parenthesis. This
possibility leads to an ambiguity in Lua's grammar. Consider the following
fragment:
>
     a = b + c
     (print or io.write)('done')
<
The grammar could see it in two ways:
>
     a = b + c(print or io.write)('done')
     
     a = b + c; (print or io.write)('done')
<
The current parser always sees such constructions in the first way,
interpreting the open parenthesis as the start of the arguments to a call. To
avoid this ambiguity, it is a good practice to always precede with a semicolon
statements that start with a parenthesis:
>
     ;(print or io.write)('done')
<
A block can be explicitly delimited to produce a single statement:
>
	stat ::= do block end
<
Explicit blocks are useful to control the scope of variable declarations.
Explicit blocks are also sometimes used to add a return statement in the
middle of another block (see |lua52-sec3.3.4|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3.2  Chunks                                                 *lua52-sec3.3.2*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The unit of compilation of Lua is called a chunk. Syntactically, a chunk is
simply a block:
>
	chunk ::= block
<
Lua handles a chunk as the body of an anonymous function with a variable
number of arguments (see |lua52-sec3.4.10|). As such, chunks can define local
variables, receive arguments, and return values. Moreover, such anonymous
function is compiled as in the scope of an external local variable called _ENV
(see |lua52-sec2.2|). The resulting function always has _ENV as its only
upvalue, even if it does not use that variable.
A chunk can be stored in a file or in a string inside the host program. To
execute a chunk, Lua first precompiles the chunk into instructions for a
virtual machine, and then it executes the compiled code with an interpreter
for the virtual machine.
Chunks can also be precompiled into binary form; see program luac for details.
Programs in source and compiled forms are interchangeable; Lua automatically
detects the file type and acts accordingly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3.3  Assignment                                             *lua52-sec3.3.3*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua allows multiple assignments. Therefore, the syntax for assignment defines
a list of variables on the left side and a list of expressions on the right
side. The elements in both lists are separated by commas:
>
	stat ::= varlist '=' explist
	varlist ::= var {',' var}
	explist ::= exp {',' exp}
<
Expressions are discussed in |lua52-sec3.4|.
Before the assignment, the list of values is adjusted to the length of the
list of variables. If there are more values than needed, the excess values are
thrown away. If there are fewer values than needed, the list is extended with
as many nil's as needed. If the list of expressions ends with a function call,
then all values returned by that call enter the list of values, before the
adjustment (except when the call is enclosed in parentheses; see
|lua52-sec3.4|).
The assignment statement first evaluates all its expressions and only then are
the assignments performed. Thus the code
>
     i = 3
     i, a[i] = i+1, 20
<
sets a[3] to 20, without affecting a[4] because the i in a[i] is evaluated (to
3) before it is assigned 4. Similarly, the line
>
     x, y = y, x
<
exchanges the values of x and y, and
>
     x, y, z = y, z, x
<
cyclically permutes the values of x, y, and z.
The meaning of assignments to global variables and table fields can be changed
via metatables. An assignment to an indexed variable t[i] = val is equivalent
to settable_event(t,i,val). (See |lua52-sec2.4| for a complete description of
the settable_event function. This function is not defined or callable in Lua.
We use it here only for explanatory purposes.)
An assignment to a global variable x = val is equivalent to the assignment
_ENV.x = val (see |lua52-sec2.2|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3.4  Control Structures                                     *lua52-sec3.3.4*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The control structures if, while, and repeat have the usual meaning and
familiar syntax:
>
	stat ::= while exp do block end
	stat ::= repeat block until exp
	stat ::= if exp then block {elseif exp then block} [else block] end
<
Lua also has a for statement, in two flavors (see |lua52-sec3.3.5|).
The condition expression of a control structure can return any value. Both
false and nil are considered false. All values different from nil and false
are considered true (in particular, the number 0 and the empty string are also
true).
In the repeat-until loop, the inner block does not end at the until keyword,
but only after the condition. So, the condition can refer to local variables
declared inside the loop block.
The goto statement transfers the program control to a label. For syntactical
reasons, labels in Lua are considered statements too:
>
	stat ::= goto Name
	stat ::= label
	label ::= '::' Name '::'
<
A label is visible in the entire block where it is defined, except inside
nested blocks where a label with the same name is defined and inside nested
functions. A goto may jump to any visible label as long as it does not enter
into the scope of a local variable.
Labels and empty statements are called void statements, as they perform no
actions.
The break statement terminates the execution of a while, repeat, or for loop,
skipping to the next statement after the loop:
>
	stat ::= break
<
A break ends the innermost enclosing loop.
The return statement is used to return values from a function or a chunk
(which is a function in disguise). Functions can return more than one value,
so the syntax for the return statement is
>
	stat ::= return [explist] [';']
<
The return statement can only be written as the last statement of a block. If
it is really necessary to return in the middle of a block, then an explicit
inner block can be used, as in the idiom do return end, because now return is
the last statement in its (inner) block.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3.5  For Statement                                          *lua52-sec3.3.5*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The for statement has two forms: one numeric and one generic.
The numeric for loop repeats a block of code while a control variable runs
through an arithmetic progression. It has the following syntax:
>
	stat ::= for Name '=' exp ',' exp [',' exp] do block end
<
The block is repeated for name starting at the value of the first exp, until
it passes the second exp by steps of the third exp. More precisely, a for
statement like
>
     for v = e1, e2, e3 do block end
<
is equivalent to the code:
>
     do
       local var, limit, step = tonumber(e1), tonumber(e2), tonumber(e3)
       if not (var and limit and step) then error() end
       while (step > 0 and var <= limit) or (step <= 0 and var >= limit) do
         local v = var
         block
         var = var + step
       end
     end
<
Note the following:
- All three control expressions are evaluated only once, before the loop
  starts. They must all result in numbers.
- var, limit, and step are invisible variables. The names shown here are for
  explanatory purposes only.
- If the third expression (the step) is absent, then a step of 1 is used.
- You can use break to exit a for loop.
- The loop variable v is local to the loop; you cannot use its value after the
  for ends or is broken. If you need this value, assign it to another variable
  before breaking or exiting the loop.
The generic for statement works over functions, called iterators. On each
iteration, the iterator function is called to produce a new value, stopping
when this new value is nil. The generic for loop has the following syntax:
>
	stat ::= for namelist in explist do block end
	namelist ::= Name {',' Name}
<
A for statement like
>
     for var_1, ..., var_n in explist do block end
<
is equivalent to the code:
>
     do
       local f, s, var = explist
       while true do
         local var_1, ..., var_n = f(s, var)
         if var_1 == nil then break end
         var = var_1
         block
       end
     end
<
Note the following:
- explist is evaluated only once. Its results are an iterator function, a
  state, and an initial value for the first iterator variable.
- f, s, and var are invisible variables. The names are here for explanatory
  purposes only.
- You can use break to exit a for loop.
- The loop variables var_i are local to the loop; you cannot use their values
  after the for ends. If you need these values, then assign them to other
  variables before breaking or exiting the loop.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3.6  Function Calls as Statements                           *lua52-sec3.3.6*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To allow possible side-effects, function calls can be executed as statements:
>
	stat ::= functioncall
<
In this case, all returned values are thrown away. Function calls are
explained in |lua52-sec3.4.9|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3.7  Local Declarations                                     *lua52-sec3.3.7*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Local variables can be declared anywhere inside a block. The declaration can
include an initial assignment:
>
	stat ::= local namelist ['=' explist]
<
If present, an initial assignment has the same semantics of a multiple
assignment (see |lua52-sec3.3.3|). Otherwise, all variables are initialized
with nil.
A chunk is also a block (see |lua52-sec3.3.2|), and so local variables can be
declared in a chunk outside any explicit block.
The visibility rules for local variables are explained in |lua52-sec3.5|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4  Expressions                                                *lua52-sec3.4*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The basic expressions in Lua are the following:
>
	exp ::= prefixexp
	exp ::= nil | false | true
	exp ::= Number
	exp ::= String
	exp ::= functiondef
	exp ::= tableconstructor
	exp ::= '...'
	exp ::= exp binop exp
	exp ::= unop exp
	prefixexp ::= var | functioncall | '(' exp ')'
<
Numbers and literal strings are explained in |lua52-sec3.1|; variables are
explained in |lua52-sec3.2|; function definitions are explained in
|lua52-sec3.4.10|; function calls are explained in |lua52-sec3.4.9|; table
constructors are explained in |lua52-sec3.4.8|. Vararg expressions, denoted by
three dots ('...'), can only be used when directly inside a vararg function;
they are explained in |lua52-sec3.4.10|.
Binary operators comprise arithmetic operators (see |lua52-sec3.4.1|),
relational operators (see |lua52-sec3.4.3|), logical operators (see
|lua52-sec3.4.4|), and the concatenation operator (see |lua52-sec3.4.5|).
Unary operators comprise the unary minus (see |lua52-sec3.4.1|), the unary not
(see |lua52-sec3.4.4|), and the unary length operator (see |lua52-sec3.4.6|).
Both function calls and vararg expressions can result in multiple values. If a
function call is used as a statement (see |lua52-sec3.3.6|), then its return
list is adjusted to zero elements, thus discarding all returned values. If an
expression is used as the last (or the only) element of a list of expressions,
then no adjustment is made (unless the expression is enclosed in parentheses).
In all other contexts, Lua adjusts the result list to one element, either
discarding all values except the first one or adding a single nil if there are
no values.
Here are some examples:
>
     f()                -- adjusted to 0 results
     g(f(), x)          -- f() is adjusted to 1 result
     g(x, f())          -- g gets x plus all results from f()
     a,b,c = f(), x     -- f() is adjusted to 1 result (c gets nil)
     a,b = ...          -- a gets the first vararg parameter, b gets
                        -- the second (both a and b can get nil if there
                        -- is no corresponding vararg parameter)
     
     a,b,c = x, f()     -- f() is adjusted to 2 results
     a,b,c = f()        -- f() is adjusted to 3 results
     return f()         -- returns all results from f()
     return ...         -- returns all received vararg parameters
     return x,y,f()     -- returns x, y, and all results from f()
     {f()}              -- creates a list with all results from f()
     {...}              -- creates a list with all vararg parameters
     {f(), nil}         -- f() is adjusted to 1 result
<
Any expression enclosed in parentheses always results in only one value. Thus,
(f(x,y,z)) is always a single value, even if f returns several values. (The
value of (f(x,y,z)) is the first value returned by f or nil if f does not
return any values.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4.1  Arithmetic Operators                                   *lua52-sec3.4.1*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua supports the usual arithmetic operators: the binary + (addition), -
(subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), % (modulo), and ^
(exponentiation); and unary - (mathematical negation). If the operands are
numbers, or strings that can be converted to numbers (see |lua52-sec3.4.2|),
then all operations have the usual meaning. Exponentiation works for any
exponent. For instance, x^(-0.5) computes the inverse of the square root of x.
Modulo is defined as
>
     a % b == a - math.floor(a/b)*b
<
That is, it is the remainder of a division that rounds the quotient towards
minus infinity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4.2  Coercion                                               *lua52-sec3.4.2*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua provides automatic conversion between string and number values at run
time. Any arithmetic operation applied to a string tries to convert this
string to a number, following the rules of the Lua lexer. (The string may have
leading and trailing spaces and a sign.) Conversely, whenever a number is used
where a string is expected, the number is converted to a string, in a
reasonable format. For complete control over how numbers are converted to
strings, use the format function from the string library (see
|lua52-string.format|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4.3  Relational Operators                                   *lua52-sec3.4.3*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The relational operators in Lua are
>
     ==    ~=    <     >     <=    >=
<
These operators always result in false or true.
Equality (==) first compares the type of its operands. If the types are
different, then the result is false. Otherwise, the values of the operands are
compared. Numbers and strings are compared in the usual way. Tables, userdata,
and threads are compared by reference: two objects are considered equal only
if they are the same object. Every time you create a new object (a table,
userdata, or thread), this new object is different from any previously
existing object. Closures with the same reference are always equal. Closures
with any detectable difference (different behavior, different definition) are
always different.
You can change the way that Lua compares tables and userdata by using the "eq"
metamethod (see |lua52-sec2.4|).
The conversion rules of |lua52-sec3.4.2| do not apply to equality comparisons.
Thus, "0"==0 evaluates to false, and t[0] and t["0"] denote different entries
in a table.
The operator ~= is exactly the negation of equality (==).
The order operators work as follows. If both arguments are numbers, then they
are compared as such. Otherwise, if both arguments are strings, then their
values are compared according to the current locale. Otherwise, Lua tries to
call the "lt" or the "le" metamethod (see |lua52-sec2.4|). A comparison a > b
is translated to b < a and a >= b is translated to b <= a.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4.4  Logical Operators                                      *lua52-sec3.4.4*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The logical operators in Lua are and, or, and not. Like the control structures
(see |lua52-sec3.3.4|), all logical operators consider both false and nil as
false and anything else as true.
The negation operator not always returns false or true. The conjunction
operator and returns its first argument if this value is false or nil;
otherwise, and returns its second argument. The disjunction operator or
returns its first argument if this value is different from nil and false;
otherwise, or returns its second argument. Both and and or use short-cut
evaluation; that is, the second operand is evaluated only if necessary. Here
are some examples:
>
     10 or 20            --> 10
     10 or error()       --> 10
     nil or "a"          --> "a"
     nil and 10          --> nil
     false and error()   --> false
     false and nil       --> false
     false or nil        --> nil
     10 and 20           --> 20
<
(In this manual, --> indicates the result of the preceding expression.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4.5  Concatenation                                          *lua52-sec3.4.5*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The string concatenation operator in Lua is denoted by two dots ('..'). If
both operands are strings or numbers, then they are converted to strings
according to the rules mentioned in |lua52-sec3.4.2|. Otherwise, the __concat
metamethod is called (see |lua52-sec2.4|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4.6  The Length Operator                                    *lua52-sec3.4.6*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The length operator is denoted by the unary prefix operator #. The length of a
string is its number of bytes (that is, the usual meaning of string length
when each character is one byte).
A program can modify the behavior of the length operator for any value but
strings through the __len metamethod (see |lua52-sec2.4|).
Unless a __len metamethod is given, the length of a table t is only defined if
the table is a sequence, that is, the set of its positive numeric keys is
equal to {1..n} for some non-negative integer n. In that case, n is its
length. Note that a table like
>
     {10, 20, nil, 40}
<
is not a sequence, because it has the key 4 but does not have the key 3. (So,
there is no n such that the set {1..n} is equal to the set of positive numeric
keys of that table.) Note, however, that non-numeric keys do not interfere
with whether a table is a sequence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4.7  Precedence                                             *lua52-sec3.4.7*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operator precedence in Lua follows the table below, from lower to higher
priority:
>
     or
     and
     <     >     <=    >=    ~=    ==
     ..
     +     -
     *     /     %
     not   #     - (unary)
     ^
<
As usual, you can use parentheses to change the precedences of an expression.
The concatenation ('..') and exponentiation ('^') operators are right
associative. All other binary operators are left associative.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4.8  Table Constructors                                     *lua52-sec3.4.8*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Table constructors are expressions that create tables. Every time a
constructor is evaluated, a new table is created. A constructor can be used to
create an empty table or to create a table and initialize some of its fields.
The general syntax for constructors is
>
	tableconstructor ::= '{' [fieldlist] '}'
	fieldlist ::= field {fieldsep field} [fieldsep]
	field ::= '[' exp ']' '=' exp | Name '=' exp | exp
	fieldsep ::= ',' | ';'
<
Each field of the form [exp1] = exp2 adds to the new table an entry with key
exp1 and value exp2. A field of the form name = exp is equivalent to ["name"]
= exp. Finally, fields of the form exp are equivalent to [i] = exp, where i
are consecutive numerical integers, starting with 1. Fields in the other
formats do not affect this counting. For example,
>
     a = { [f(1)] = g; "x", "y"; x = 1, f(x), [30] = 23; 45 }
<
is equivalent to
>
     do
       local t = {}
       t[f(1)] = g
       t[1] = "x"         -- 1st exp
       t[2] = "y"         -- 2nd exp
       t.x = 1            -- t["x"] = 1
       t[3] = f(x)        -- 3rd exp
       t[30] = 23
       t[4] = 45          -- 4th exp
       a = t
     end
<
If the last field in the list has the form exp and the expression is a
function call or a vararg expression, then all values returned by this
expression enter the list consecutively (see |lua52-sec3.4.9|).
The field list can have an optional trailing separator, as a convenience for
machine-generated code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4.9  Function Calls                                         *lua52-sec3.4.9*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A function call in Lua has the following syntax:
>
	functioncall ::= prefixexp args
<
In a function call, first prefixexp and args are evaluated. If the value of
prefixexp has type function, then this function is called with the given
arguments. Otherwise, the prefixexp "call" metamethod is called, having as
first parameter the value of prefixexp, followed by the original call
arguments (see |lua52-sec2.4|).
The form
>
	functioncall ::= prefixexp ':' Name args
<
can be used to call "methods". A call v:name(args) is syntactic sugar for
v.name(v,args), except that v is evaluated only once.
Arguments have the following syntax:
>
	args ::= '(' [explist] ')'
	args ::= tableconstructor
	args ::= String
<
All argument expressions are evaluated before the call. A call of the form
f{fields} is syntactic sugar for f({fields}); that is, the argument list is a
single new table. A call of the form f'string' (or f"string" or f[[string]])
is syntactic sugar for f('string'); that is, the argument list is a single
literal string.
A call of the form return functioncall is called a tail call. Lua implements
proper tail calls (or proper tail recursion): in a tail call, the called
function reuses the stack entry of the calling function. Therefore, there is
no limit on the number of nested tail calls that a program can execute.
However, a tail call erases any debug information about the calling function.
Note that a tail call only happens with a particular syntax, where the return
has one single function call as argument; this syntax makes the calling
function return exactly the returns of the called function. So, none of the
following examples are tail calls:
>
     return (f(x))        -- results adjusted to 1
     return 2 * f(x)
     return x, f(x)       -- additional results
     f(x); return         -- results discarded
     return x or f(x)     -- results adjusted to 1

3.4.10  Function Definitions                                 *lua52-sec3.4.10*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The syntax for function definition is
>
	functiondef ::= function funcbody
	funcbody ::= '(' [parlist] ')' block end
<
The following syntactic sugar simplifies function definitions:
>
	stat ::= function funcname funcbody
	stat ::= local function Name funcbody
	funcname ::= Name {'.' Name} [':' Name]
<
The statement
>
     function f () body end
<
translates to
>
     f = function () body end
<
The statement
>
     function t.a.b.c.f () body end
<
translates to
>
     t.a.b.c.f = function () body end
<
The statement
>
     local function f () body end
<
translates to
>
     local f; f = function () body end
<
not to
>
     local f = function () body end
<
(This only makes a difference when the body of the function contains
references to f.)
A function definition is an executable expression, whose value has type
function. When Lua precompiles a chunk, all its function bodies are
precompiled too. Then, whenever Lua executes the function definition, the
function is instantiated (or closed). This function instance (or closure) is
the final value of the expression.
Parameters act as local variables that are initialized with the argument
values:
>
	parlist ::= namelist [',' '...'] | '...'
<
When a function is called, the list of arguments is adjusted to the length of
the list of parameters, unless the function is a vararg function, which is
indicated by three dots ('...') at the end of its parameter list. A vararg
function does not adjust its argument list; instead, it collects all extra
arguments and supplies them to the function through a vararg expression, which
is also written as three dots. The value of this expression is a list of all
actual extra arguments, similar to a function with multiple results. If a
vararg expression is used inside another expression or in the middle of a list
of expressions, then its return list is adjusted to one element. If the
expression is used as the last element of a list of expressions, then no
adjustment is made (unless that last expression is enclosed in parentheses).
As an example, consider the following definitions:
>
     function f(a, b) end
     function g(a, b, ...) end
     function r() return 1,2,3 end
<
Then, we have the following mapping from arguments to parameters and to the
vararg expression:
>
     CALL            PARAMETERS
     
     f(3)             a=3, b=nil
     f(3, 4)          a=3, b=4
     f(3, 4, 5)       a=3, b=4
     f(r(), 10)       a=1, b=10
     f(r())           a=1, b=2
     
     g(3)             a=3, b=nil, ... -->  (nothing)
     g(3, 4)          a=3, b=4,   ... -->  (nothing)
     g(3, 4, 5, 8)    a=3, b=4,   ... -->  5  8
     g(5, r())        a=5, b=1,   ... -->  2  3
<
Results are returned using the return statement (see |lua52-sec3.3.4|). If
control reaches the end of a function without encountering a return statement,
then the function returns with no results.
There is a system-dependent limit on the number of values that a function may
return. This limit is guaranteed to be larger than 1000.
The colon syntax is used for defining methods, that is, functions that have an
implicit extra parameter self. Thus, the statement
>
     function t.a.b.c:f (params) body end
<
is syntactic sugar for
>
     t.a.b.c.f = function (self, params) body end
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.5  Visibility Rules                                           *lua52-sec3.5*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua is a lexically scoped language. The scope of a local variable begins at
the first statement after its declaration and lasts until the last non-void
statement of the innermost block that includes the declaration. Consider the
following example:
>
     x = 10                -- global variable
     do                    -- new block
       local x = x         -- new 'x', with value 10
       print(x)            --> 10
       x = x+1
       do                  -- another block
         local x = x+1     -- another 'x'
         print(x)          --> 12
       end
       print(x)            --> 11
     end
     print(x)              --> 10  (the global one)
<
Notice that, in a declaration like local x = x, the new x being declared is
not in scope yet, and so the second x refers to the outside variable.
Because of the lexical scoping rules, local variables can be freely accessed
by functions defined inside their scope. A local variable used by an inner
function is called an upvalue, or external local variable, inside the inner
function.
Notice that each execution of a local statement defines new local variables.
Consider the following example:
>
     a = {}
     local x = 20
     for i=1,10 do
       local y = 0
       a[i] = function () y=y+1; return x+y end
     end
<
The loop creates ten closures (that is, ten instances of the anonymous
function). Each of these closures uses a different y variable, while all of
them share the same x.

4.  The Application Program Interface                             *lua52-sec4*
==============================================================================
                                                      *lua52-LUA_USE_APICHECK*

This section describes the C API for Lua, that is, the set of C functions
available to the host program to communicate with Lua. All API functions and
related types and constants are declared in the header file lua.h.
Even when we use the term "function", any facility in the API may be provided
as a macro instead. Except where stated otherwise, all such macros use each of
their arguments exactly once (except for the first argument, which is always a
Lua state), and so do not generate any hidden side-effects.
As in most C libraries, the Lua API functions do not check their arguments for
validity or consistency. However, you can change this behavior by compiling
Lua with the macro LUA_USE_APICHECK defined.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1  The Stack                                                  *lua52-sec4.1*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua uses a virtual stack to pass values to and from C. Each element in this
stack represents a Lua value (nil, number, string, etc.).
Whenever Lua calls C, the called function gets a new stack, which is
independent of previous stacks and of stacks of C functions that are still
active. This stack initially contains any arguments to the C function and it
is where the C function pushes its results to be returned to the caller (see
|lua52-lua_CFunction|).
For convenience, most query operations in the API do not follow a strict stack
discipline. Instead, they can refer to any element in the stack by using an
index: A positive index represents an absolute stack position (starting at 1);
a negative index represents an offset relative to the top of the stack. More
specifically, if the stack has n elements, then index 1 represents the first
element (that is, the element that was pushed onto the stack first) and index
n represents the last element; index -1 also represents the last element (that
is, the element at the top) and index -n represents the first element.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2  Stack Size                                                 *lua52-sec4.2*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                          *lua52-LUA_MINSTACK*

When you interact with the Lua API, you are responsible for ensuring
consistency. In particular, you are responsible for controlling stack
overflow. You can use the function |lua52-lua_checkstack| to ensure that the
stack has extra slots when pushing new elements.
Whenever Lua calls C, it ensures that the stack has at least LUA_MINSTACK
extra slots. LUA_MINSTACK is defined as 20, so that usually you do not have to
worry about stack space unless your code has loops pushing elements onto the
stack.
When you call a Lua function without a fixed number of results (see
|lua52-lua_call|), Lua ensures that the stack has enough size for all results,
but it does not ensure any extra space. So, before pushing anything in the
stack after such a call you should use |lua52-lua_checkstack|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3  Valid and Acceptable Indices                               *lua52-sec4.3*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             *lua52-LUA_TNONE*

Any function in the API that receives stack indices works only with valid
indices or acceptable indices.
A valid index is an index that refers to a real position within the stack,
that is, its position lies between 1 and the stack top (1 <= abs(index) <=
top). Usually, functions that can modify the value at an index require valid
indices.
Unless otherwise noted, any function that accepts valid indices also accepts
pseudo-indices, which represent some Lua values that are accessible to C code
but which are not in the stack. Pseudo-indices are used to access the registry
and the upvalues of a C function (see |lua52-sec4.4|).
Functions that do not need a specific stack position, but only a value in the
stack (e.g., query functions), can be called with acceptable indices. An
acceptable index can be any valid index, including the pseudo-indices, but it
also can be any positive index after the stack top within the space allocated
for the stack, that is, indices up to the stack size. (Note that 0 is never an
acceptable index.) Except when noted otherwise, functions in the API work with
acceptable indices.
Acceptable indices serve to avoid extra tests against the stack top when
querying the stack. For instance, a C function can query its third argument
without the need to first check whether there is a third argument, that is,
without the need to check whether 3 is a valid index.
For functions that can be called with acceptable indices, any non-valid index
is treated as if it contains a value of a virtual type LUA_TNONE, which
behaves like a nil value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.4  C Closures                                                 *lua52-sec4.4*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a C function is created, it is possible to associate some values with it,
thus creating a C closure (see |lua52-lua_pushcclosure|); these values are
called upvalues and are accessible to the function whenever it is called.
Whenever a C function is called, its upvalues are located at specific
pseudo-indices. These pseudo-indices are produced by the macro
|lua52-lua_upvalueindex|. The first value associated with a function is at
position lua_upvalueindex(1), and so on. Any access to lua_upvalueindex(n),
where n is greater than the number of upvalues of the current function (but
not greater than 256), produces an acceptable but invalid index.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.5  Registry                                                   *lua52-sec4.5*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                     *lua52-LUA_REGISTRYINDEX*
                                                   *lua52-LUA_RIDX_MAINTHREAD*
                                                      *lua52-LUA_RIDX_GLOBALS*

Lua provides a registry, a predefined table that can be used by any C code to
store whatever Lua values it needs to store. The registry table is always
located at pseudo-index LUA_REGISTRYINDEX, which is a valid index. Any C
library can store data into this table, but it should take care to choose keys
that are different from those used by other libraries, to avoid collisions.
Typically, you should use as key a string containing your library name, or a
light userdata with the address of a C object in your code, or any Lua object
created by your code. As with global names, string keys starting with an
underscore followed by uppercase letters are reserved for Lua.
The integer keys in the registry are used by the reference mechanism,
implemented by the auxiliary library, and by some predefined values.
Therefore, integer keys should not be used for other purposes.
When you create a new Lua state, its registry comes with some predefined
values. These predefined values are indexed with integer keys defined as
constants in lua.h. The following constants are defined:
- LUA_RIDX_MAINTHREAD: At this index the registry has the main thread of the
  state. (The main thread is the one created together with the state.)
- LUA_RIDX_GLOBALS: At this index the registry has the global environment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.6  Error Handling in C                                        *lua52-sec4.6*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Internally, Lua uses the C longjmp facility to handle errors. (You can also
choose to use exceptions if you compile Lua as C++; search for LUAI_THROW in
the source code.) When Lua faces any error (such as a memory allocation error,
type errors, syntax errors, and runtime errors) it raises an error; that is,
it does a long jump. A protected environment uses setjmp to set a recovery
point; any error jumps to the most recent active recovery point.
If an error happens outside any protected environment, Lua calls a panic
function (see |lua52-lua_atpanic|) and then calls abort, thus exiting the host
application. Your panic function can avoid this exit by never returning (e.g.,
doing a long jump to your own recovery point outside Lua).
The panic function runs as if it were a message handler (see |lua52-sec2.3|);
in particular, the error message is at the top of the stack. However, there is
no guarantees about stack space. To push anything on the stack, the panic
function should first check the available space (see |lua52-sec4.2|).
Most functions in the API can throw an error, for instance due to a memory
allocation error. The documentation for each function indicates whether it can
throw errors.
Inside a C function you can throw an error by calling |lua52-lua_error|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.7  Handling Yields in C                                       *lua52-sec4.7*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Internally, Lua uses the C longjmp facility to yield a coroutine. Therefore,
if a function foo calls an API function and this API function yields (directly
or indirectly by calling another function that yields), Lua cannot return to
foo any more, because the longjmp removes its frame from the C stack.
To avoid this kind of problem, Lua raises an error whenever it tries to yield
across an API call, except for three functions: |lua52-lua_yieldk|,
|lua52-lua_callk|, and |lua52-lua_pcallk|. All those functions receive a
continuation function (as a parameter called k) to continue execution after a
yield.
We need to set some terminology to explain continuations. We have a C function
called from Lua which we will call the original function. This original
function then calls one of those three functions in the C API, which we will
call the callee function, that then yields the current thread. (This can
happen when the callee function is |lua52-lua_yieldk|, or when the callee
function is either |lua52-lua_callk| or |lua52-lua_pcallk| and the function
called by them yields.)
Suppose the running thread yields while executing the callee function. After
the thread resumes, it eventually will finish running the callee function.
However, the callee function cannot return to the original function, because
its frame in the C stack was destroyed by the yield. Instead, Lua calls a
continuation function, which was given as an argument to the callee function.
As the name implies, the continuation function should continue the task of the
original function.
Lua treats the continuation function as if it were the original function. The
continuation function receives the same Lua stack from the original function,
in the same state it would be if the callee function had returned. (For
instance, after a |lua52-lua_callk| the function and its arguments are removed
from the stack and replaced by the results from the call.) It also has the
same upvalues. Whatever it returns is handled by Lua as if it were the return
of the original function.
The only difference in the Lua state between the original function and its
continuation is the result of a call to |lua52-lua_getctx|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.8  Functions and Types                                        *lua52-sec4.8*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here we list all functions and types from the C API in alphabetical order.
Each function has an indicator like this:
                                                                   [-o, +p, x]
The first field, o, is how many elements the function pops from the stack. The
second field, p, is how many elements the function pushes onto the stack. (Any
function always pushes its results after popping its arguments.) A field in
the form x|y means the function can push (or pop) x or y elements, depending
on the situation; an interrogation mark '?' means that we cannot know how many
elements the function pops/pushes by looking only at its arguments (e.g., they
may depend on what is on the stack). The third field, x, tells whether the
function may throw errors: '-' means the function never throws any error; 'e'
means the function may throw errors; 'v' means the function may throw an error
on purpose.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua52-lua_absindex*
lua_absindex ~
                                                                   [-0, +0, -]
>
    int lua_absindex (lua_State *L, int idx);
<
Converts the acceptable index idx into an absolute index (that is, one that
does not depend on the stack top).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua52-lua_Alloc*
lua_Alloc ~
>
    typedef void * (*lua_Alloc) (void *ud,
                                 void *ptr,
                                 size_t osize,
                                 size_t nsize);
<
The type of the memory-allocation function used by Lua states. The allocator
function must provide a functionality similar to realloc, but not exactly the
same. Its arguments are ud, an opaque pointer passed to |lua52-lua_newstate|;
ptr, a pointer to the block being allocated/reallocated/freed; osize, the
original size of the block or some code about what is being allocated; nsize,
the new size of the block.
When ptr is not NULL, osize is the size of the block pointed by ptr, that is,
the size given when it was allocated or reallocated.
When ptr is NULL, osize encodes the kind of object that Lua is allocating.
osize is any of LUA_TSTRING (|lua52-LUA_TSTRING|), LUA_TTABLE
(|lua52-LUA_TTABLE|), LUA_TFUNCTION (|lua52-LUA_TFUNCTION|), LUA_TUSERDATA
(|lua52-LUA_TUSERDATA|), or LUA_TTHREAD (|lua52-LUA_TTHREAD|) when (and only
when) Lua is creating a new object of that type. When osize is some other
value, Lua is allocating memory for something else.
Lua assumes the following behavior from the allocator function:
When nsize is zero, the allocator should behave like free and return NULL.
When nsize is not zero, the allocator should behave like realloc. The
allocator returns NULL if and only if it cannot fulfill the request. Lua
assumes that the allocator never fails when osize >= nsize.
Here is a simple implementation for the allocator function. It is used in the
auxiliary library by |lua52-luaL_newstate|.
>
     static void *l_alloc (void *ud, void *ptr, size_t osize,
                                                size_t nsize) {
       (void)ud;  (void)osize;  /* not used */
       if (nsize == 0) {
         free(ptr);
         return NULL;
       }
       else
         return realloc(ptr, nsize);
     }
<
Note that Standard C ensures that free(NULL) has no effect and that
realloc(NULL, size) is equivalent to malloc(size). This code assumes that
realloc does not fail when shrinking a block. (Although Standard C does not
ensure this behavior, it seems to be a safe assumption.)

Performs an arithmetic operation over the two values (or one, in the case of
negation) at the top of the stack, with the value at the top being the second
operand, pops these values, and pushes the result of the operation. The
function follows the semantics of the corresponding Lua operator (that is, it
may call metamethods).
The value of op must be one of the following constants:
- LUA_OPADD: performs addition (+)
- LUA_OPSUB: performs subtraction (-)
- LUA_OPMUL: performs multiplication (*)
- LUA_OPDIV: performs division (/)
- LUA_OPMOD: performs modulo (%)
- LUA_OPPOW: performs exponentiation (^)
- LUA_OPUNM: performs mathematical negation (unary -)

    void lua_call (lua_State *L, int nargs, int nresults);
<
Calls a function.
To call a function you must use the following protocol: first, the function to
be called is pushed onto the stack; then, the arguments to the function are
pushed in direct order; that is, the first argument is pushed first. Finally
you call |lua52-lua_call|; nargs is the number of arguments that you pushed
onto the stack. All arguments and the function value are popped from the stack
when the function is called. The function results are pushed onto the stack
when the function returns. The number of results is adjusted to nresults,
unless nresults is LUA_MULTRET. In this case, all results from the function
are pushed. Lua takes care that the returned values fit into the stack space.
The function results are pushed onto the stack in direct order (the first
result is pushed first), so that after the call the last result is on the top
of the stack.
Any error inside the called function is propagated upwards (with a longjmp).
The following example shows how the host program can do the equivalent to this
Lua code:
>
     a = f("how", t.x, 14)
<
Here it is in C:
>
     lua_getglobal(L, "f");                  /* function to be called */
     lua_pushstring(L, "how");                        /* 1st argument */
     lua_getglobal(L, "t");                    /* table to be indexed */
     lua_getfield(L, -1, "x");        /* push result of t.x (2nd arg) */
     lua_remove(L, -2);                  /* remove 't' from the stack */
     lua_pushinteger(L, 14);                          /* 3rd argument */
     lua_call(L, 3, 1);     /* call 'f' with 3 arguments and 1 result */
     lua_setglobal(L, "a");                         /* set global 'a' */
<
Note that the code above is "balanced": at its end, the stack is back to its
original configuration. This is considered good programming practice.

This function behaves exactly like |lua52-lua_call|, but allows the called
function to yield (see |lua52-sec4.7|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                         *lua52-lua_CFunction*
lua_CFunction ~
>
    typedef int (*lua_CFunction) (lua_State *L);
<
Type for C functions.
In order to communicate properly with Lua, a C function must use the following
protocol, which defines the way parameters and results are passed: a C
function receives its arguments from Lua in its stack in direct order (the
first argument is pushed first). So, when the function starts, lua_gettop(L)
returns the number of arguments received by the function. The first argument
(if any) is at index 1 and its last argument is at index lua_gettop(L). To
return values to Lua, a C function just pushes them onto the stack, in direct
order (the first result is pushed first), and returns the number of results.
Any other value in the stack below the results will be properly discarded by
Lua. Like a Lua function, a C function called by Lua can also return many
results.
As an example, the following function receives a variable number of numerical
arguments and returns their average and sum:
>
     static int foo (lua_State *L) {
       int n = lua_gettop(L);    /* number of arguments */
       lua_Number sum = 0;
       int i;
       for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
         if (!lua_isnumber(L, i)) {
           lua_pushstring(L, "incorrect argument");
           lua_error(L);
         }
         sum += lua_tonumber(L, i);
       }
       lua_pushnumber(L, sum/n);        /* first result */
       lua_pushnumber(L, sum);         /* second result */
       return 2;                   /* number of results */
     }

    int lua_checkstack (lua_State *L, int extra);
<
Ensures that there are at least extra free stack slots in the stack. It
returns false if it cannot fulfill the request, because it would cause the
stack to be larger than a fixed maximum size (typically at least a few
thousand elements) or because it cannot allocate memory for the new stack
size. This function never shrinks the stack; if the stack is already larger
than the new size, it is left unchanged.

    void lua_close (lua_State *L);
<
Destroys all objects in the given Lua state (calling the corresponding
garbage-collection metamethods, if any) and frees all dynamic memory used by
this state. On several platforms, you may not need to call this function,
because all resources are naturally released when the host program ends. On
the other hand, long-running programs that create multiple states, such as
daemons or web servers, might need to close states as soon as they are not
needed.

>
    int lua_compare (lua_State *L, int index1, int index2, int op);
<
Compares two Lua values. Returns 1 if the value at index index1 satisfies op
when compared with the value at index index2, following the semantics of the
corresponding Lua operator (that is, it may call metamethods). Otherwise
returns 0. Also returns 0 if any of the indices is non valid.
The value of op must be one of the following constants:
- LUA_OPEQ: compares for equality (==)
- LUA_OPLT: compares for less than (<)
- LUA_OPLE: compares for less or equal (<=)

>
    void lua_concat (lua_State *L, int n);
<
Concatenates the n values at the top of the stack, pops them, and leaves the
result at the top. If n is 1, the result is the single value on the stack
(that is, the function does nothing); if n is 0, the result is the empty
string. Concatenation is performed following the usual semantics of Lua (see
|lua52-sec3.4.5|).

Moves the element at index fromidx into the valid index toidx without shifting
any element (therefore replacing the value at that position).

>
    void lua_createtable (lua_State *L, int narr, int nrec);
<
Creates a new empty table and pushes it onto the stack. Parameter narr is a
hint for how many elements the table will have as a sequence; parameter nrec
is a hint for how many other elements the table will have. Lua may use these
hints to preallocate memory for the new table. This pre-allocation is useful
for performance when you know in advance how many elements the table will
have. Otherwise you can use the function |lua52-lua_newtable|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>
    int lua_dump (lua_State *L, lua_Writer writer, void *data);
<
Dumps a function as a binary chunk. Receives a Lua function on the top of the
stack and produces a binary chunk that, if loaded again, results in a function
equivalent to the one dumped. As it produces parts of the chunk,
|lua52-lua_dump| calls function writer (see |lua52-lua_Writer|) with the given
data to write them.
The value returned is the error code returned by the last call to the writer;
0 means no errors.
This function does not pop the Lua function from the stack.

>
    int lua_error (lua_State *L);
<
Generates a Lua error. The error message (which can actually be a Lua value of
any type) must be on the stack top. This function does a long jump, and
therefore never returns (see |lua52-luaL_error|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>
    int lua_gc (lua_State *L, int what, int data);
<
Controls the garbage collector.
This function performs several tasks, according to the value of the parameter
what:
- LUA_GCSTOP: stops the garbage collector.
- LUA_GCRESTART: restarts the garbage collector.
- LUA_GCCOLLECT: performs a full garbage-collection cycle.
- LUA_GCCOUNT: returns the current amount of memory (in Kbytes) in use by Lua.
- LUA_GCCOUNTB: returns the remainder of dividing the current amount of bytes
  of memory in use by Lua by 1024.
- LUA_GCSTEP: performs an incremental step of garbage collection. The step
  "size" is controlled by data (larger values mean more steps) in a
  non-specified way. If you want to control the step size you must
  experimentally tune the value of data. The function returns 1 if the step
  finished a garbage-collection cycle.
- LUA_GCSETPAUSE: sets data as the new value for the pause of the collector
  (see |lua52-sec2.5|). The function returns the previous value of the pause.
- LUA_GCSETSTEPMUL: sets data as the new value for the step multiplier of the
  collector (see |lua52-sec2.5|). The function returns the previous value of
  the step multiplier.
- LUA_GCISRUNNING: returns a boolean that tells whether the collector is
  running (i.e., not stopped).
- LUA_GCGEN: changes the collector to generational mode (see |lua52-sec2.5|).
- LUA_GCINC: changes the collector to incremental mode. This is the default
  mode.
For more details about these options, see |lua52-collectgarbage|.

    lua_Alloc lua_getallocf (lua_State *L, void **ud);

Lua stores in *ud the opaque pointer passed to |lua52-lua_newstate|.

>
    int lua_getctx (lua_State *L, int *ctx);
<
This function is called by a continuation function (see |lua52-sec4.7|) to
retrieve the status of the thread and a context information.
When called in the original function, |lua52-lua_getctx| always returns LUA_OK
(|lua52-LUA_OK|) and does not change the value of its argument ctx. When
called inside a continuation function, |lua52-lua_getctx| returns LUA_YIELD
(|lua52-LUA_YIELD|) and sets the value of ctx to be the context information
(the value passed as the ctx argument to the callee together with the
continuation function).
When the callee is |lua52-lua_pcallk|, Lua may also call its continuation
function to handle errors during the call. That is, upon an error in the
function called by |lua52-lua_pcallk|, Lua may not return to the original
function but instead may call the continuation function. In that case, a call
to |lua52-lua_getctx| will return the error code (the value that would be
returned by |lua52-lua_pcallk|); the value of ctx will be set to the context
information, as in the case of a yield.

    int lua_getmetatable (lua_State *L, int index);

Pushes onto the stack the metatable of the value at the given index. If the
value does not have a metatable, the function returns 0 and pushes nothing on
the stack.

Pushes onto the stack the value t[k], where t is the value at the given index

    int lua_gettop (lua_State *L);

                  const char *source,
                  const char *mode);
<
Loads a Lua chunk (without running it). If there are no errors, lua_load
pushes the compiled chunk as a Lua function on top of the stack. Otherwise, it
pushes an error message.
The return values of lua_load are:
- LUA_OK (|lua52-LUA_OK|): no errors;
- LUA_ERRSYNTAX: syntax error during precompilation;
- LUA_ERRMEM (|lua52-LUA_ERRMEM|): memory allocation error;
- LUA_ERRGCMM (|lua52-LUA_ERRGCMM|): error while running a __gc metamethod.
  (This error has no relation with the chunk being loaded. It is generated by
  the garbage collector.)
The lua_load function uses a user-supplied reader function to read the chunk
(see |lua52-lua_Reader|). The data argument is an opaque value passed to the
reader function.
The source argument gives a name to the chunk, which is used for error
messages and in debug information (see |lua52-sec4.9|).
lua_load automatically detects whether the chunk is text or binary and loads
it accordingly (see program luac). The string mode works as in function
|lua52-load|, with the addition that a NULL value is equivalent to the string
"bt".
lua_load uses the stack internally, so the reader function should always leave
the stack unmodified when returning.
If the resulting function has one upvalue, this upvalue is set to the value of
the global environment stored at index LUA_RIDX_GLOBALS in the registry (see
|lua52-sec4.5|). When loading main chunks, this upvalue will be the _ENV
variable (see |lua52-sec2.2|).

    lua_State *lua_newstate (lua_Alloc f, void *ud);
<
Creates a new thread running in a new, independent state. Returns NULL if
cannot create the thread or the state (due to lack of memory). The argument f
is the allocator function; Lua does all memory allocation for this state
through this function. The second argument, ud, is an opaque pointer that Lua
passes to the allocator in every call.

>
    lua_State *lua_newthread (lua_State *L);
<
Creates a new thread, pushes it on the stack, and returns a pointer to a
|lua52-lua_State| that represents this new thread. The new thread returned by
this function shares with the original thread its global environment, but has
an independent execution stack.
There is no explicit function to close or to destroy a thread. Threads are
subject to garbage collection, like any Lua object.

the stack a new full userdata with the block address, and returns this
address. The host program can freely use this memory.

>
    int lua_next (lua_State *L, int index);
<
Pops a key from the stack, and pushes a key-value pair from the table at the
given index (the "next" pair after the given key). If there are no more
elements in the table, then |lua52-lua_next| returns 0 (and pushes nothing).
A typical traversal looks like this:
>
     /* table is in the stack at index 't' */
     lua_pushnil(L);  /* first key */
     while (lua_next(L, t) != 0) {
       /* uses 'key' (at index -2) and 'value' (at index -1) */
       printf("%s - %s\n",
              lua_typename(L, lua_type(L, -2)),
              lua_typename(L, lua_type(L, -1)));
       /* removes 'value'; keeps 'key' for next iteration */
       lua_pop(L, 1);
     }
<
While traversing a table, do not call |lua52-lua_tolstring| directly on a key,
unless you know that the key is actually a string. Recall that
|lua52-lua_tolstring| may change the value at the given index; this confuses
the next call to |lua52-lua_next|.
See function |lua52-next| for the caveats of modifying the table during its
traversal.

>
    int lua_pcall (lua_State *L, int nargs, int nresults, int msgh);
<
Calls a function in protected mode.
Both nargs and nresults have the same meaning as in |lua52-lua_call|. If there
are no errors during the call, |lua52-lua_pcall| behaves exactly like
|lua52-lua_call|. However, if there is any error, |lua52-lua_pcall| catches
it, pushes a single value on the stack (the error message), and returns an
error code. Like |lua52-lua_call|, |lua52-lua_pcall| always removes the
function and its arguments from the stack.
If msgh is 0, then the error message returned on the stack is exactly the
original error message. Otherwise, msgh is the stack index of a message
handler. (In the current implementation, this index cannot be a pseudo-index.)
In case of runtime errors, this function will be called with the error message
and its return value will be the message returned on the stack by
|lua52-lua_pcall|.
Typically, the message handler is used to add more debug information to the
error message, such as a stack traceback. Such information cannot be gathered
after the return of |lua52-lua_pcall|, since by then the stack has unwound.
The |lua52-lua_pcall| function returns one of the following codes (defined in
lua.h):
- LUA_OK (0): success.
- LUA_ERRRUN: a runtime error.
- LUA_ERRMEM: memory allocation error. For such errors, Lua does not call the
  message handler.
- LUA_ERRERR: error while running the message handler.
- LUA_ERRGCMM: error while running a __gc metamethod. (This error typically
  has no relation with the function being called. It is generated by the
  garbage collector.)

>
    void lua_pushcclosure (lua_State *L, lua_CFunction fn, int n);
<
Pushes a new C closure onto the stack.
When a C function is created, it is possible to associate some values with it,
thus creating a C closure (see |lua52-sec4.4|); these values are then
accessible to the function whenever it is called. To associate values with a C
function, first these values should be pushed onto the stack (when there are
multiple values, the first value is pushed first). Then
|lua52-lua_pushcclosure| is called to create and push the C function onto the
stack, with the argument n telling how many values should be associated with
the function. |lua52-lua_pushcclosure| also pops these values from the stack.
The maximum value for n is 255.
When n is zero, this function creates a light C function, which is just a
pointer to the C function. In that case, it never throws a memory error.

>
    void lua_pushcfunction (lua_State *L, lua_CFunction f);
<
Pushes a C function onto the stack. This function receives a pointer to a C
function and pushes onto the stack a Lua value of type function that, when
called, invokes the corresponding C function.
Any function to be registered in Lua must follow the correct protocol to
receive its parameters and return its results (see |lua52-lua_CFunction|).
lua_pushcfunction is defined as a macro:
>
     #define lua_pushcfunction(L,f)  lua_pushcclosure(L,f,0)

    const char *lua_pushfstring (lua_State *L, const char *fmt, ...);
<
Pushes onto the stack a formatted string and returns a pointer to this string.
It is similar to the ISO C function sprintf, but has some important
differences:
- You do not have to allocate space for the result: the result is a Lua string
  and Lua takes care of memory allocation (and deallocation, through garbage
  collection).
- The conversion specifiers are quite restricted. There are no flags, widths,
  or precisions. The conversion specifiers can only be '%%' (inserts a '%' in
  the string), '%s' (inserts a zero-terminated string, with no size
  restrictions), '%f' (inserts a |lua52-lua_Number|), '%p' (inserts a pointer
  as a hexadecimal numeral), '%d' (inserts an int), and '%c' (inserts an int
  as a byte).

Pushes a light userdata onto the stack.
Userdata represent C values in Lua. A light userdata represents a pointer, a
void*. It is a value (like a number): you do not create it, it has no
individual metatable, and it is not collected (as it was never created). A
light userdata is equal to "any" light userdata with the same C address.

Pushes the string pointed to by s with size len onto the stack. Lua makes (or
reuses) an internal copy of the given string, so the memory at s can be freed
or reused immediately after the function returns. The string can contain any
binary data, including embedded zeros.
Returns a pointer to the internal copy of the string.

piece of the chunk and set size to the block size. The block must exist until
the reader function is called again. To signal the end of the chunk, the
reader must return NULL or set size to zero. The reader function may return
pieces of any size greater than zero.

    int lua_resume (lua_State *L, lua_State *from, int nargs);
<
Starts and resumes a coroutine in a given thread.
To start a coroutine, you push onto the thread stack the main function plus
any arguments; then you call |lua52-lua_resume|, with nargs being the number
of arguments. This call returns when the coroutine suspends or finishes its
execution. When it returns, the stack contains all values passed to
|lua52-lua_yield|, or all values returned by the body function.
|lua52-lua_resume| returns LUA_YIELD (|lua52-LUA_YIELD|) if the coroutine
yields, LUA_OK (|lua52-LUA_OK|) if the coroutine finishes its execution
without errors, or an error code in case of errors (see |lua52-lua_pcall|).
In case of errors, the stack is not unwound, so you can use the debug API over
it. The error message is on the top of the stack.
To resume a coroutine, you remove any results from the last |lua52-lua_yield|,
put on its stack only the values to be passed as results from yield, and then
call |lua52-lua_resume|.
The parameter from represents the coroutine that is resuming L. If there is no
such coroutine, this parameter can be NULL.

    const char *lua_tolstring (lua_State *L, int index, size_t *len);
<
Converts the Lua value at the given index to a C string. If len is not NULL,
it also sets *len with the string length. The Lua value must be a string or a
number; otherwise, the function returns NULL. If the value is a number, then
lua_tolstring also changes the actual value in the stack to a string. (This
change confuses |lua52-lua_next| when lua_tolstring is applied to keys during
a table traversal.)
lua_tolstring returns a fully aligned pointer to a string inside the Lua
state. This string always has a zero ('\0') after its last character (as in
C), but can contain other zeros in its body. Because Lua has garbage
collection, there is no guarantee that the pointer returned by lua_tolstring
will be valid after the corresponding value is removed from the stack.

lua_topointer returns NULL. Different objects will give different pointers.
There is no way to convert the pointer back to its original value.

The type of the writer function used by |lua52-lua_dump|. Every time it

This function is equivalent to |lua52-lua_yieldk|, but it has no continuation

function that called the function calling lua_yield.

    int lua_yieldk (lua_State *L, int nresults, int ctx, lua_CFunction k);
<
Yields a coroutine.
This function should only be called as the return expression of a C function,
as follows:
>
     return lua_yieldk (L, n, i, k);
<
When a C function calls |lua52-lua_yieldk| in that way, the running coroutine
suspends its execution, and the call to |lua52-lua_resume| that started this
coroutine returns. The parameter nresults is the number of values from the
stack that are passed as results to |lua52-lua_resume|.
When the coroutine is resumed again, Lua calls the given continuation function
k to continue the execution of the C function that yielded (see
|lua52-sec4.7|). This continuation function receives the same stack from the
previous function, with the results removed and replaced by the arguments
passed to |lua52-lua_resume|. Moreover, the continuation function may access
the value ctx by calling |lua52-lua_getctx|.

Lua has no built-in debugging facilities. Instead, it offers a special
interface by means of functions and hooks. This interface allows the
construction of different kinds of debuggers, profilers, and other tools that
need "inside information" from the interpreter.

<
A structure used to carry different pieces of information about a function or
an activation record. |lua52-lua_getstack| fills only the private part of this
structure, for later use. To fill the other fields of |lua52-lua_Debug| with
useful information, call |lua52-lua_getinfo|.
The fields of |lua52-lua_Debug| have the following meaning:
- source: the source of the chunk that created the function. If source starts
  with a '@', it means that the function was defined in a file where the file
  name follows the '@'. If source starts with a '=', the remainder of its
  contents describe the source in a user-dependent manner. Otherwise, the
  function was defined in a string where source is that string.
- short_src: a "printable" version of source, to be used in error messages.
- linedefined: the line number where the definition of the function starts.
- lastlinedefined: the line number where the definition of the function ends.
- what: the string "Lua" if the function is a Lua function, "C" if it is a C
  function, "main" if it is the main part of a chunk.
- currentline: the current line where the given function is executing. When no
  line information is available, currentline is set to -1.
- name: a reasonable name for the given function. Because functions in Lua are
  first-class values, they do not have a fixed name: some functions can be the
  value of multiple global variables, while others can be stored only in a
  table field. The lua_getinfo function checks how the function was called to
  find a suitable name. If it cannot find a name, then name is set to NULL.
- namewhat: explains the name field. The value of namewhat can be "global",
  "local", "method", "field", "upvalue", or "" (the empty string), according
  to how the function was called. (Lua uses the empty string when no other
  option seems to apply.)
- istailcall: true if this function invocation was called by a tail call. In
  this case, the caller of this level is not in the stack.
- nups: the number of upvalues of the function.
- nparams: the number of fixed parameters of the function (always 0 for C
  functions).
- isvararg: true if the function is a vararg function (always true for C
  functions).

    int lua_getinfo (lua_State *L, const char *what, lua_Debug *ar);
<
Gets information about a specific function or function invocation.
To get information about a function invocation, the parameter ar must be a
valid activation record that was filled by a previous call to
|lua52-lua_getstack| or given as argument to a hook (see |lua52-lua_Hook|).
To get information about a function you push it onto the stack and start the
what string with the character '>'. (In that case, lua_getinfo pops the
function from the top of the stack.) For instance, to know in which line a
function f was defined, you can write the following code:
>
     lua_Debug ar;
     lua_getglobal(L, "f");  /* get global 'f' */
     lua_getinfo(L, ">S", &ar);
     printf("%d\n", ar.linedefined);
<
Each character in the string what selects some fields of the structure ar to
be filled or a value to be pushed on the stack:
- 'n': fills in the field name and namewhat;
- 'S': fills in the fields source, short_src, linedefined, lastlinedefined,
  and what;
- 'l': fills in the field currentline;
- 't': fills in the field istailcall;
- 'u': fills in the fields nups, nparams, and isvararg;
- 'f': pushes onto the stack the function that is running at the given level;
- 'L': pushes onto the stack a table whose indices are the numbers of the
  lines that are valid on the function. (A valid line is a line with some
  associated code, that is, a line where you can put a break point. Non-valid
  lines include empty lines and comments.)

    const char *lua_getlocal (lua_State *L, lua_Debug *ar, int n);
<
Gets information about a local variable of a given activation record or a
given function.
In the first case, the parameter ar must be a valid activation record that was
filled by a previous call to |lua52-lua_getstack| or given as argument to a
hook (see |lua52-lua_Hook|). The index n selects which local variable to
inspect; see |lua52-debug.getlocal| for details about variable indices and
names.
|lua52-lua_getlocal| pushes the variable's value onto the stack and returns
its name.
In the second case, ar should be NULL and the function to be inspected must be
at the top of the stack. In this case, only parameters of Lua functions are
visible (as there is no information about what variables are active) and no
values are pushed onto the stack.
Returns NULL (and pushes nothing) when the index is greater than the number of
active local variables.

Gets information about the interpreter runtime stack.
This function fills parts of a |lua52-lua_Debug| structure with an
identification of the activation record of the function executing at a given
level. Level 0 is the current running function, whereas level n+1 is the
function that has called level n (except for tail calls, which do not count on
the stack). When there are no errors, |lua52-lua_getstack| returns 1; when
called with a level greater than the stack depth, it returns 0.

    const char *lua_getupvalue (lua_State *L, int funcindex, int n);
<
Gets information about a closure's upvalue. (For Lua functions, upvalues are
the external local variables that the function uses, and that are consequently
included in its closure.) |lua52-lua_getupvalue| gets the index n of an
upvalue, pushes the upvalue's value onto the stack, and returns its name.
funcindex points to the closure in the stack. (Upvalues have no particular
order, as they are active through the whole function. So, they are numbered in
an arbitrary order.)
Returns NULL (and pushes nothing) when the index is greater than the number of
upvalues. For C functions, this function uses the empty string "" as a name
for all upvalues.

lua_Hook ~
>
    typedef void (*lua_Hook) (lua_State *L, lua_Debug *ar);
<
Type for debugging hook functions.
Whenever a hook is called, its ar argument has its field event set to the
specific event that triggered the hook. Lua identifies these events with the
following constants: LUA_HOOKCALL, LUA_HOOKRET, LUA_HOOKTAILCALL,
LUA_HOOKLINE, and LUA_HOOKCOUNT. Moreover, for line events, the field
currentline is also set. To get the value of any other field in ar, the hook
must call |lua52-lua_getinfo|.
For call events, event can be LUA_HOOKCALL, the normal value, or
LUA_HOOKTAILCALL, for a tail call; in this case, there will be no
corresponding return event.
While Lua is running a hook, it disables other calls to hooks. Therefore, if a
hook calls back Lua to execute a function or a chunk, this execution occurs
without any calls to hooks.
Hook functions cannot have continuations, that is, they cannot call
|lua52-lua_yieldk|, |lua52-lua_pcallk|, or |lua52-lua_callk| with a non-null
k.
Hook functions can yield under the following conditions: Only count and line
events can yield and they cannot yield any value; to yield a hook function
must finish its execution calling |lua52-lua_yield| with nresults equal to
zero.

>
    int lua_sethook (lua_State *L, lua_Hook f, int mask, int count);
<
Sets the debugging hook function.
Argument f is the hook function. mask specifies on which events the hook will
be called: it is formed by a bitwise or of the constants LUA_MASKCALL,
LUA_MASKRET, LUA_MASKLINE, and LUA_MASKCOUNT. The count argument is only
meaningful when the mask includes LUA_MASKCOUNT. For each event, the hook is
called as explained below:
- The call hook: is called when the interpreter calls a function. The hook is
  called just after Lua enters the new function, before the function gets its
  arguments.
- The return hook: is called when the interpreter returns from a function. The
  hook is called just before Lua leaves the function. There is no standard way
  to access the values to be returned by the function.
- The line hook: is called when the interpreter is about to start the
  execution of a new line of code, or when it jumps back in the code (even to
  the same line). (This event only happens while Lua is executing a Lua
  function.)
- The count hook: is called after the interpreter executes every count
  instructions. (This event only happens while Lua is executing a Lua
  function.)
A hook is disabled by setting mask to zero.

Sets the value of a local variable of a given activation record. Parameters ar
and n are as in |lua52-lua_getlocal| (see |lua52-lua_getlocal|).
|lua52-lua_setlocal| assigns the value at the top of the stack to the variable

index funcindex. Parameters funcindex and n are as in the
|lua52-lua_getupvalue| (see |lua52-lua_getupvalue|) (but n cannot be greater
than the number of upvalues).
These unique identifiers allow a program to check whether different closures
share upvalues. Lua closures that share an upvalue (that is, that access a
same external local variable) will return identical ids for those upvalue
indices.

5.  The Auxiliary Library                                         *lua52-sec5*
==============================================================================

The auxiliary library provides several convenient functions to interface C
with Lua. While the basic API provides the primitive functions for all
interactions between C and Lua, the auxiliary library provides higher-level
functions for some common tasks.
All functions and types from the auxiliary library are defined in header file
lauxlib.h and have a prefix luaL_.
All functions in the auxiliary library are built on top of the basic API, and
so they provide nothing that cannot be done with that API. Nevertheless, the
use of the auxiliary library ensures more consistency to your code.
Several functions in the auxiliary library use internally some extra stack
slots. When a function in the auxiliary library uses less than five slots, it
does not check the stack size; it simply assumes that there are enough slots.
Several functions in the auxiliary library are used to check C function
arguments. Because the error message is formatted for arguments (e.g., "bad
argument #1"), you should not use these functions for other stack values.
Functions called luaL_check* always throw an error if the check is not
satisfied.

luaL_Buffer ~
>
    typedef struct luaL_Buffer luaL_Buffer;
<
Type for a string buffer.
A string buffer allows C code to build Lua strings piecemeal. Its pattern of
use is as follows:
- First declare a variable b of type |lua52-luaL_Buffer|.
- Then initialize it with a call luaL_buffinit(L, &b).
- Then add string pieces to the buffer calling any of the luaL_add* functions.
- Finish by calling luaL_pushresult(&b). This call leaves the final string on
  the top of the stack.
If you know beforehand the total size of the resulting string, you can use the
buffer like this:
- First declare a variable b of type |lua52-luaL_Buffer|.
- Then initialize it and preallocate a space of size sz with a call
  luaL_buffinitsize(L, &b, sz).
- Then copy the string into that space.
- Finish by calling luaL_pushresultsize(&b, sz), where sz is the total size of
  the resulting string copied into that space.
During its normal operation, a string buffer uses a variable number of stack
slots. So, while using a buffer, you cannot assume that you know where the top
of the stack is. You can use the stack between successive calls to buffer
operations as long as that use is balanced; that is, when you call a buffer
operation, the stack is at the same level it was immediately after the
previous buffer operation. (The only exception to this rule is
|lua52-luaL_addvalue|.) After calling |lua52-luaL_pushresult| the stack is
back to its level when the buffer was initialized, plus the final string on
its top.

Checks whether the function argument arg is a string and returns this string;

<
Checks whether the function argument arg is a string and searches for this
string in the array lst (which must be NULL-terminated). Returns the index in
the array where the string was found. Raises an error if the argument is not a
string or if the string cannot be found.
If def is not NULL, the function uses def as a default value when there is no
argument arg or when this argument is nil.
This is a useful function for mapping strings to C enums. (The usual
convention in Lua libraries is to use strings instead of numbers to select
options.)

Loads a file as a Lua chunk. This function uses |lua52-lua_load| to load the

    int luaL_ref (lua_State *L, int t);
<
Creates and returns a reference, in the table at index t, for the object at
the top of the stack (and pops the object).
A reference is a unique integer key. As long as you do not manually add
integer keys into table t, |lua52-luaL_ref| ensures the uniqueness of the key
it returns. You can retrieve an object referred by reference r by calling
lua_rawgeti(L, t, r). Function |lua52-luaL_unref| frees a reference and its
associated object.
If the object at the top of the stack is nil, |lua52-luaL_ref| returns the
constant LUA_REFNIL. The constant LUA_NOREF is guaranteed to be different from
any reference returned by |lua52-luaL_ref|.

The standard Lua libraries provide useful functions that are implemented
directly through the C API. Some of these functions provide essential services
to the language (e.g., |lua52-type| and |lua52-getmetatable|); others provide
access to "outside" services (e.g., I/O); and others could be implemented in
Lua itself, but are quite useful or have critical performance requirements
that deserve an implementation in C (e.g., |lua52-table.sort|).
All libraries are implemented through the official C API and are provided as
separate C modules. Currently, Lua has the following standard libraries:
- basic library (|lua52-sec6.1|);
- coroutine library (|lua52-sec6.2|);
- package library (|lua52-sec6.3|);
- string manipulation (|lua52-sec6.4|);
- table manipulation (|lua52-sec6.5|);
- mathematical functions (|lua52-sec6.6|) (sin, log, etc.);
- bitwise operations (|lua52-sec6.7|);
- input and output (|lua52-sec6.8|);
- operating system facilities (|lua52-sec6.9|);
- debug facilities (|lua52-sec6.10|).
Except for the basic and the package libraries, each library provides all its
functions as fields of a global table or as methods of its objects.
To have access to these libraries, the C host program should call the
|lua52-luaL_openlibs| function, which opens all standard libraries.
Alternatively, the host program can open them individually by using
|lua52-luaL_requiref| to call luaopen_base (for the basic library),
luaopen_package (for the package library), luaopen_coroutine (for the
coroutine library), luaopen_string (for the string library), luaopen_table
(for the table library), luaopen_math (for the mathematical library),
luaopen_bit32 (for the bit library), luaopen_io (for the I/O library),
luaopen_os (for the Operating System library), and luaopen_debug (for the
debug library). These functions are declared in lualib.h.

6.1  Basic Functions                                            *lua52-sec6.1*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The basic library provides core functions to Lua. If you do not include this
library in your application, you should check carefully whether you need to
provide implementations for some of its facilities.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                *lua52-assert*
assert (v [, message]) ~

Issues an error when the value of its argument v is false (i.e., nil or
false); otherwise, returns all its arguments. message is an error message;
when absent, it defaults to "assertion failed!"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                        *lua52-collectgarbage*
collectgarbage ([opt [, arg]]) ~

This function is a generic interface to the garbage collector. It performs
different functions according to its first argument, opt:
- "collect": performs a full garbage-collection cycle. This is the default
  option.
- "stop": stops automatic execution of the garbage collector. The collector
  will run only when explicitly invoked, until a call to restart it.
- "restart": restarts automatic execution of the garbage collector.
- "count": returns the total memory in use by Lua (in Kbytes) and a second
  value with the total memory in bytes modulo 1024. The first value has a
  fractional part, so the following equality is always true:
>
       k, b = collectgarbage("count")
       assert(k*1024 == math.floor(k)*1024 + b)
<
  (The second result is useful when Lua is compiled with a non floating-point
  type for numbers.)
- "step": performs a garbage-collection step. The step "size" is controlled by
  arg (larger values mean more steps) in a non-specified way. If you want to
  control the step size you must experimentally tune the value of arg. Returns
  true if the step finished a collection cycle.
- "setpause": sets arg as the new value for the pause of the collector (see
  |lua52-sec2.5|). Returns the previous value for pause.
- "setstepmul": sets arg as the new value for the step multiplier of the
  collector (see |lua52-sec2.5|). Returns the previous value for step.
- "isrunning": returns a boolean that tells whether the collector is running
  (i.e., not stopped).
- "generational": changes the collector to generational mode. This is an
  experimental feature (see |lua52-sec2.5|).
- "incremental": changes the collector to incremental mode. This is the
  default mode.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                *lua52-dofile*
dofile ([filename]) ~

Opens the named file and executes its contents as a Lua chunk. When called
without arguments, dofile executes the contents of the standard input (stdin).
Returns all values returned by the chunk. In case of errors, dofile propagates
the error to its caller (that is, dofile does not run in protected mode).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                 *lua52-error*
error (message [, level]) ~

Terminates the last protected function called and returns message as the error
message. Function error never returns.
Usually, error adds some information about the error position at the beginning
of the message, if the message is a string. The level argument specifies how
to get the error position. With level 1 (the default), the error position is
where the error function was called. Level 2 points the error to where the
function that called error was called; and so on. Passing a level 0 avoids the
addition of error position information to the message.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                    *lua52-_G*
_G ~

A global variable (not a function) that holds the global environment (see
|lua52-sec2.2|). Lua itself does not use this variable; changing its value
does not affect any environment, nor vice-versa.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua52-getmetatable*
getmetatable (object) ~

If object does not have a metatable, returns nil. Otherwise, if the object's
metatable has a "__metatable" field, returns the associated value. Otherwise,
returns the metatable of the given object.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                *lua52-ipairs*
ipairs (t) ~

If t has a metamethod __ipairs, calls it with t as argument and returns the
first three results from the call.
Otherwise, returns three values: an iterator function, the table t, and 0, so
that the construction
>
     for i,v in ipairs(t) do body end
<
will iterate over the pairs (1,t[1]), (2,t[2]), ..., up to the first integer
key absent from the table.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                  *lua52-load*
load (ld [, source [, mode [, env]]]) ~

Loads a chunk.
If ld is a string, the chunk is this string. If ld is a function, load calls
it repeatedly to get the chunk pieces. Each call to ld must return a string
that concatenates with previous results. A return of an empty string, nil, or
no value signals the end of the chunk.
If there are no syntactic errors, returns the compiled chunk as a function;
otherwise, returns nil plus the error message.
If the resulting function has upvalues, the first upvalue is set to the value
of env, if that parameter is given, or to the value of the global environment.
(When you load a main chunk, the resulting function will always have exactly
one upvalue, the _ENV variable (see |lua52-sec2.2|). When you load a binary
chunk created from a function (see |lua52-string.dump|), the resulting
function can have arbitrary upvalues.)
source is used as the source of the chunk for error messages and debug
information (see |lua52-sec4.9|). When absent, it defaults to ld, if ld is a
string, or to "=(load)" otherwise.
The string mode controls whether the chunk can be text or binary (that is, a
precompiled chunk). It may be the string "b" (only binary chunks), "t" (only
text chunks), or "bt" (both binary and text). The default is "bt".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua52-loadfile*
loadfile ([filename [, mode [, env]]]) ~

Similar to |lua52-load|, but gets the chunk from file filename or from the
standard input, if no file name is given.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                  *lua52-next*
next (table [, index]) ~

Allows a program to traverse all fields of a table. Its first argument is a
table and its second argument is an index in this table. next returns the next
index of the table and its associated value. When called with nil as its
second argument, next returns an initial index and its associated value. When
called with the last index, or with nil in an empty table, next returns nil.
If the second argument is absent, then it is interpreted as nil. In
particular, you can use next(t) to check whether a table is empty.
The order in which the indices are enumerated is not specified, even for
numeric indices. (To traverse a table in numeric order, use a numerical for.)
The behavior of next is undefined if, during the traversal, you assign any
value to a non-existent field in the table. You may however modify existing
fields. In particular, you may clear existing fields.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                 *lua52-pairs*
pairs (t) ~

If t has a metamethod __pairs, calls it with t as argument and returns the
first three results from the call.
Otherwise, returns three values: the |lua52-next| function, the table t, and
nil, so that the construction
>
     for k,v in pairs(t) do body end
<
will iterate over all key-value pairs of table t.
See function |lua52-next| for the caveats of modifying the table during its
traversal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                 *lua52-pcall*
pcall (f [, arg1, ...]) ~

Calls function f with the given arguments in protected mode. This means that
any error inside f is not propagated; instead, pcall catches the error and
returns a status code. Its first result is the status code (a boolean), which
is true if the call succeeds without errors. In such case, pcall also returns
all results from the call, after this first result. In case of any error,
pcall returns false plus the error message.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                 *lua52-print*
print (...) ~

Receives any number of arguments and prints their values to stdout, using the
|lua52-tostring| function to convert each argument to a string. print is not
intended for formatted output, but only as a quick way to show a value, for
instance for debugging. For complete control over the output, use
|lua52-string.format| and |lua52-io.write|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua52-rawequal*
rawequal (v1, v2) ~

Checks whether v1 is equal to v2, without invoking any metamethod. Returns a
boolean.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                *lua52-rawget*
rawget (table, index) ~

Gets the real value of table[index], without invoking any metamethod. table
must be a table; index may be any value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                *lua52-rawlen*
rawlen (v) ~

Returns the length of the object v, which must be a table or a string, without
invoking any metamethod. Returns an integer number.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                *lua52-rawset*
rawset (table, index, value) ~

Sets the real value of table[index] to value, without invoking any metamethod.
table must be a table, index any value different from nil and NaN, and value
any Lua value.
This function returns table.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                *lua52-select*
select (index, ...) ~

If index is a number, returns all arguments after argument number index; a
negative number indexes from the end (-1 is the last argument). Otherwise,
index must be the string "#", and select returns the total number of extra
arguments it received.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua52-setmetatable*
setmetatable (table, metatable) ~

Sets the metatable for the given table. (You cannot change the metatable of
other types from Lua, only from C.) If metatable is nil, removes the metatable
of the given table. If the original metatable has a "__metatable" field,
raises an error.
This function returns table.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua52-tonumber*
tonumber (e [, base]) ~

When called with no base, tonumber tries to convert its argument to a number.
If the argument is already a number or a string convertible to a number (see
|lua52-sec3.4.2|), then tonumber returns this number; otherwise, it returns
nil.
When called with base, then e should be a string to be interpreted as an
integer numeral in that base. The base may be any integer between 2 and 36,
inclusive. In bases above 10, the letter 'A' (in either upper or lower case)
represents 10, 'B' represents 11, and so forth, with 'Z' representing 35. If
the string e is not a valid numeral in the given base, the function returns
nil.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua52-tostring*
tostring (v) ~

Receives a value of any type and converts it to a string in a reasonable
format. (For complete control of how numbers are converted, use
|lua52-string.format|.)
If the metatable of v has a "__tostring" field, then tostring calls the
corresponding value with v as argument, and uses the result of the call as its
result.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                  *lua52-type*
type (v) ~

Returns the type of its only argument, coded as a string. The possible results
of this function are "nil" (a string, not the value nil), "number", "string",
"boolean", "table", "function", "thread", and "userdata".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua52-_VERSION*
_VERSION ~

A global variable (not a function) that holds a string containing the current
interpreter version. The current contents of this variable is "Lua 5.2".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                *lua52-xpcall*
xpcall (f, msgh [, arg1, ...]) ~

This function is similar to |lua52-pcall|, except that it sets a new message
handler msgh.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.2  Coroutine Manipulation                                     *lua52-sec6.2*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The operations related to coroutines comprise a sub-library of the basic
library and come inside the table coroutine. See |lua52-sec2.6| for a general
description of coroutines.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                      *lua52-coroutine.create*
coroutine.create (f) ~

Creates a new coroutine, with body f. f must be a Lua function. Returns this
new coroutine, an object with type "thread".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                      *lua52-coroutine.resume*
coroutine.resume (co [, val1, ...]) ~

Starts or continues the execution of coroutine co. The first time you resume a
coroutine, it starts running its body. The values val1, ... are passed as the
arguments to the body function. If the coroutine has yielded, resume restarts
it; the values val1, ... are passed as the results from the yield.
If the coroutine runs without any errors, resume returns true plus any values
passed to yield (if the coroutine yields) or any values returned by the body
function (if the coroutine terminates). If there is any error, resume returns
false plus the error message.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                     *lua52-coroutine.running*
coroutine.running () ~

Returns the running coroutine plus a boolean, true when the running coroutine
is the main one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                      *lua52-coroutine.status*
coroutine.status (co) ~

Returns the status of coroutine co, as a string: "running", if the coroutine
is running (that is, it called status); "suspended", if the coroutine is
suspended in a call to yield, or if it has not started running yet; "normal"
if the coroutine is active but not running (that is, it has resumed another
coroutine); and "dead" if the coroutine has finished its body function, or if
it has stopped with an error.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                        *lua52-coroutine.wrap*
coroutine.wrap (f) ~

Creates a new coroutine, with body f. f must be a Lua function. Returns a
function that resumes the coroutine each time it is called. Any arguments
passed to the function behave as the extra arguments to resume. Returns the
same values returned by resume, except the first boolean. In case of error,
propagates the error.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                       *lua52-coroutine.yield*
coroutine.yield (...) ~

Suspends the execution of the calling coroutine. Any arguments to yield are
passed as extra results to resume.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.3  Modules                                                    *lua52-sec6.3*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The package library provides basic facilities for loading modules in Lua. It
exports one function directly in the global environment: |lua52-require|.
Everything else is exported in a table package.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               *lua52-require*
require (modname) ~

Loads the given module. The function starts by looking into the
|lua52-package.loaded| table to determine whether modname is already loaded.
If it is, then require returns the value stored at package.loaded[modname].
Otherwise, it tries to find a loader for the module.
To find a loader, require is guided by the |lua52-package.searchers| sequence.
By changing this sequence, we can change how require looks for a module. The
following explanation is based on the default configuration for
|lua52-package.searchers|.
First require queries package.preload[modname]. If it has a value, this value
(which should be a function) is the loader. Otherwise require searches for a
Lua loader using the path stored in |lua52-package.path|. If that also fails,
it searches for a C loader using the path stored in |lua52-package.cpath|. If
that also fails, it tries an all-in-one loader (see
|lua52-package.searchers|).
Once a loader is found, require calls the loader with two arguments: modname
and an extra value dependent on how it got the loader. (If the loader came
from a file, this extra value is the file name.) If the loader returns any
non-nil value, require assigns the returned value to package.loaded[modname].
If the loader does not return a non-nil value and has not assigned any value
to package.loaded[modname], then require assigns true to this entry. In any
case, require returns the final value of package.loaded[modname].
If there is any error loading or running the module, or if it cannot find any
loader for the module, then require raises an error.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                        *lua52-package.config*
package.config ~

A string describing some compile-time configurations for packages. This string
is a sequence of lines:
- The first line is the directory separator string. Default is '\' for Windows
  and '/' for all other systems.
- The second line is the character that separates templates in a path. Default
  is ';'.
- The third line is the string that marks the substitution points in a
  template. Default is '?'.
- The fourth line is a string that, in a path in Windows, is replaced by the
  executable's directory. Default is '!'.
- The fifth line is a mark to ignore all text before it when building the
  luaopen_ function name. Default is '-'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                         *lua52-LUA_CPATH_5_2*
                                                             *lua52-LUA_CPATH*
                                                         *lua52-package.cpath*
package.cpath ~

The path used by |lua52-require| to search for a C loader.
Lua initializes the C path |lua52-package.cpath| in the same way it
initializes the Lua path |lua52-package.path|, using the environment variable
LUA_CPATH_5_2 or the environment variable LUA_CPATH or a default path defined
in luaconf.h.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                        *lua52-package.loaded*
package.loaded ~

A table used by |lua52-require| to control which modules are already loaded.
When you require a module modname and package.loaded[modname] is not false,
|lua52-require| simply returns the value stored there.
This variable is only a reference to the real table; assignments to this
variable do not change the table used by |lua52-require|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                       *lua52-package.loadlib*
package.loadlib (libname, funcname) ~

Dynamically links the host program with the C library libname.
If funcname is "*", then it only links with the library, making the symbols
exported by the library available to other dynamically linked libraries.
Otherwise, it looks for a function funcname inside the library and returns
this function as a C function. So, funcname must follow the
|lua52-lua_CFunction| prototype (see |lua52-lua_CFunction|).
This is a low-level function. It completely bypasses the package and module
system. Unlike |lua52-require|, it does not perform any path searching and
does not automatically adds extensions. libname must be the complete file name
of the C library, including if necessary a path and an extension. funcname
must be the exact name exported by the C library (which may depend on the C
compiler and linker used).
This function is not supported by Standard C. As such, it is only available on
some platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, BSD, plus other Unix
systems that support the dlfcn standard).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua52-LUA_PATH_5_2*
                                                              *lua52-LUA_PATH*
                                                          *lua52-package.path*
package.path ~

The path used by |lua52-require| to search for a Lua loader.
At start-up, Lua initializes this variable with the value of the environment
variable LUA_PATH_5_2 or the environment variable LUA_PATH or with a default
path defined in luaconf.h, if those environment variables are not defined. Any
";;" in the value of the environment variable is replaced by the default path.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                       *lua52-package.preload*
package.preload ~

A table to store loaders for specific modules (see |lua52-require|).
This variable is only a reference to the real table; assignments to this
variable do not change the table used by |lua52-require|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                     *lua52-package.searchers*
package.searchers ~

A table used by |lua52-require| to control how to load modules.
Each entry in this table is a searcher function. When looking for a module,
|lua52-require| calls each of these searchers in ascending order, with the
module name (the argument given to |lua52-require|) as its sole parameter. The
function can return another function (the module loader) plus an extra value
that will be passed to that loader, or a string explaining why it did not find
that module (or nil if it has nothing to say).
Lua initializes this table with four searcher functions.
The first searcher simply looks for a loader in the |lua52-package.preload|
table.
The second searcher looks for a loader as a Lua library, using the path stored
at |lua52-package.path|. The search is done as described in function
|lua52-package.searchpath|.
The third searcher looks for a loader as a C library, using the path given by
the variable |lua52-package.cpath|. Again, the search is done as described in
function |lua52-package.searchpath|. For instance, if the C path is the string
>
     "./?.so;./?.dll;/usr/local/?/init.so"
<
the searcher for module foo will try to open the files ./foo.so, ./foo.dll,
and /usr/local/foo/init.so, in that order. Once it finds a C library, this
searcher first uses a dynamic link facility to link the application with the
library. Then it tries to find a C function inside the library to be used as
the loader. The name of this C function is the string "luaopen_" concatenated
with a copy of the module name where each dot is replaced by an underscore.
Moreover, if the module name has a hyphen, its prefix up to (and including)
the first hyphen is removed. For instance, if the module name is a.v1-b.c, the
function name will be luaopen_b_c.
The fourth searcher tries an all-in-one loader. It searches the C path for a
library for the root name of the given module. For instance, when requiring
a.b.c, it will search for a C library for a. If found, it looks into it for an
open function for the submodule; in our example, that would be luaopen_a_b_c.
With this facility, a package can pack several C submodules into one single
library, with each submodule keeping its original open function.
All searchers except the first one (preload) return as the extra value the
file name where the module was found, as returned by
|lua52-package.searchpath|. The first searcher returns no extra value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                    *lua52-package.searchpath*
package.searchpath (name, path [, sep [, rep]]) ~

Searches for the given name in the given path.
A path is a string containing a sequence of templates separated by semicolons.
For each template, the function replaces each interrogation mark (if any) in
the template with a copy of name wherein all occurrences of sep (a dot, by
default) were replaced by rep (the system's directory separator, by default),
and then tries to open the resulting file name.
For instance, if the path is the string
>
     "./?.lua;./?.lc;/usr/local/?/init.lua"
<
the search for the name foo.a will try to open the files ./foo/a.lua,
./foo/a.lc, and /usr/local/foo/a/init.lua, in that order.
Returns the resulting name of the first file that it can open in read mode
(after closing the file), or nil plus an error message if none succeeds. (This
error message lists all file names it tried to open.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.4  String Manipulation                                        *lua52-sec6.4*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library provides generic functions for string manipulation, such as
finding and extracting substrings, and pattern matching. When indexing a
string in Lua, the first character is at position 1 (not at 0, as in C).
Indices are allowed to be negative and are interpreted as indexing backwards,
from the end of the string. Thus, the last character is at position -1, and so
on.
The string library provides all its functions inside the table string. It also
sets a metatable for strings where the __index field points to the string
table. Therefore, you can use the string functions in object-oriented style.
For instance, string.byte(s,i) can be written as s:byte(i).
The string library assumes one-byte character encodings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *lua52-string.byte*
string.byte (s [, i [, j]]) ~

Returns the internal numerical codes of the characters s[i], s[i+1], ...,
s[j]. The default value for i is 1; the default value for j is i. These
indices are corrected following the same rules of function |lua52-string.sub|.
Numerical codes are not necessarily portable across platforms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *lua52-string.char*
string.char (...) ~

Receives zero or more integers. Returns a string with length equal to the
number of arguments, in which each character has the internal numerical code
equal to its corresponding argument.
Numerical codes are not necessarily portable across platforms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *lua52-string.dump*
string.dump (function) ~

Returns a string containing a binary representation of the given function, so
that a later |lua52-load| on this string returns a copy of the function (but
with new upvalues).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *lua52-string.find*
string.find (s, pattern [, init [, plain]]) ~

Looks for the first match of pattern in the string s. If it finds a match,
then find returns the indices of s where this occurrence starts and ends;
otherwise, it returns nil. A third, optional numerical argument init specifies
where to start the search; its default value is 1 and can be negative. A value
of true as a fourth, optional argument plain turns off the pattern matching
facilities, so the function does a plain "find substring" operation, with no
characters in pattern being considered magic. Note that if plain is given,
then init must be given as well.
If the pattern has captures, then in a successful match the captured values
are also returned, after the two indices.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                         *lua52-string.format*
string.format (formatstring, ...) ~

Returns a formatted version of its variable number of arguments following the
description given in its first argument (which must be a string). The format
string follows the same rules as the ISO C function sprintf. The only
differences are that the options/modifiers *, h, L, l, n, and p are not
supported and that there is an extra option, q. The q option formats a string
between double quotes, using escape sequences when necessary to ensure that it
can safely be read back by the Lua interpreter. For instance, the call
>
     string.format('%q', 'a string with "quotes" and \n new line')
<
may produce the string:
>
     "a string with \"quotes\" and \
      new line"
<
Options A and a (when available), E, e, f, G, and g all expect a number as
argument. Options c, d, i, o, u, X, and x also expect a number, but the range
of that number may be limited by the underlying C implementation. For options
o, u, X, and x, the number cannot be negative. Option q expects a string;
option s expects a string without embedded zeros. If the argument to option s
is not a string, it is converted to one following the same rules of
|lua52-tostring|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                         *lua52-string.gmatch*
string.gmatch (s, pattern) ~

Returns an iterator function that, each time it is called, returns the next
captures from pattern over the string s. If pattern specifies no captures,
then the whole match is produced in each call.
As an example, the following loop will iterate over all the words from string
s, printing one per line:
>
     s = "hello world from Lua"
     for w in string.gmatch(s, "%a+") do
       print(w)
     end
<
The next example collects all pairs key=value from the given string into a
table:
>
     t = {}
     s = "from=world, to=Lua"
     for k, v in string.gmatch(s, "(%w+)=(%w+)") do
       t[k] = v
     end
<
For this function, a caret '^' at the start of a pattern does not work as an
anchor, as this would prevent the iteration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *lua52-string.gsub*
string.gsub (s, pattern, repl [, n]) ~

Returns a copy of s in which all (or the first n, if given) occurrences of the
pattern have been replaced by a replacement string specified by repl, which
can be a string, a table, or a function. gsub also returns, as its second
value, the total number of matches that occurred. The name gsub comes from
Global SUBstitution.
If repl is a string, then its value is used for replacement. The character %
works as an escape character: any sequence in repl of the form %d, with d
between 1 and 9, stands for the value of the d-th captured substring. The
sequence %0 stands for the whole match. The sequence %% stands for a single %.
If repl is a table, then the table is queried for every match, using the first
capture as the key.
If repl is a function, then this function is called every time a match occurs,
with all captured substrings passed as arguments, in order.
In any case, if the pattern specifies no captures, then it behaves as if the
whole pattern was inside a capture.
If the value returned by the table query or by the function call is a string
or a number, then it is used as the replacement string; otherwise, if it is
false or nil, then there is no replacement (that is, the original match is
kept in the string).
Here are some examples:
>
     x = string.gsub("hello world", "(%w+)", "%1 %1")
     --> x="hello hello world world"
     
     x = string.gsub("hello world", "%w+", "%0 %0", 1)
     --> x="hello hello world"
     
     x = string.gsub("hello world from Lua", "(%w+)%s*(%w+)", "%2 %1")
     --> x="world hello Lua from"
     
     x = string.gsub("home = $HOME, user = $USER", "%$(%w+)", os.getenv)
     --> x="home = /home/roberto, user = roberto"
     
     x = string.gsub("4+5 = $return 4+5$", "%$(.-)%$", function (s)
           return load(s)()
         end)
     --> x="4+5 = 9"
     
     local t = {name="lua", version="5.2"}
     x = string.gsub("$name-$version.tar.gz", "%$(%w+)", t)
     --> x="lua-5.2.tar.gz"
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua52-string.len*
string.len (s) ~

Receives a string and returns its length. The empty string "" has length 0.
Embedded zeros are counted, so "a\000bc\000" has length 5.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua52-string.lower*
string.lower (s) ~

Receives a string and returns a copy of this string with all uppercase letters
changed to lowercase. All other characters are left unchanged. The definition
of what an uppercase letter is depends on the current locale.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua52-string.match*
string.match (s, pattern [, init]) ~

Looks for the first match of pattern in the string s. If it finds one, then
match returns the captures from the pattern; otherwise it returns nil. If
pattern specifies no captures, then the whole match is returned. A third,
optional numerical argument init specifies where to start the search; its
default value is 1 and can be negative.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua52-string.rep*
string.rep (s, n [, sep]) ~

Returns a string that is the concatenation of n copies of the string s
separated by the string sep. The default value for sep is the empty string
(that is, no separator).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                        *lua52-string.reverse*
string.reverse (s) ~

Returns a string that is the string s reversed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua52-string.sub*
string.sub (s, i [, j]) ~

Returns the substring of s that starts at i and continues until j; i and j can
be negative. If j is absent, then it is assumed to be equal to -1 (which is
the same as the string length). In particular, the call string.sub(s,1,j)
returns a prefix of s with length j, and string.sub(s, -i) returns a suffix of
s with length i.
If, after the translation of negative indices, i is less than 1, it is
corrected to 1. If j is greater than the string length, it is corrected to
that length. If, after these corrections, i is greater than j, the function
returns the empty string.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua52-string.upper*
string.upper (s) ~

Receives a string and returns a copy of this string with all lowercase letters
changed to uppercase. All other characters are left unchanged. The definition
of what a lowercase letter is depends on the current locale.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.4.1  Patterns                                               *lua52-sec6.4.1*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Character Class:
A character class is used to represent a set of characters. The following
combinations are allowed in describing a character class:
- x: (where x is not one of the magic characters ^$()%.[]*+-?) represents the
  character x itself.
- .: (a dot) represents all characters.
- %a: represents all letters.
- %c: represents all control characters.
- %d: represents all digits.
- %g: represents all printable characters except space.
- %l: represents all lowercase letters.
- %p: represents all punctuation characters.
- %s: represents all space characters.
- %u: represents all uppercase letters.
- %w: represents all alphanumeric characters.
- %x: represents all hexadecimal digits.
- %x: (where x is any non-alphanumeric character) represents the character x.
  This is the standard way to escape the magic characters. Any punctuation
  character (even the non magic) can be preceded by a '%' when used to
  represent itself in a pattern.
- [set]: represents the class which is the union of all characters in set. A
  range of characters can be specified by separating the end characters of the
  range, in ascending order, with a '-', All classes %x described above can
  also be used as components in set. All other characters in set represent
  themselves. For example, [%w_] (or [_%w]) represents all alphanumeric
  characters plus the underscore, [0-7] represents the octal digits, and
  [0-7%l%-] represents the octal digits plus the lowercase letters plus the
  '-' character.
  The interaction between ranges and classes is not defined. Therefore,
  patterns like [%a-z] or [a-%%] have no meaning.
- [^set]: represents the complement of set, where set is interpreted as above.
For all classes represented by single letters (%a, %c, etc.), the
corresponding uppercase letter represents the complement of the class. For
instance, %S represents all non-space characters.
The definitions of letter, space, and other character groups depend on the
current locale. In particular, the class [a-z] may not be equivalent to %l.
Pattern Item:
A pattern item can be
- a single character class, which matches any single character in the class;
- a single character class followed by '*', which matches 0 or more
  repetitions of characters in the class. These repetition items will always
  match the longest possible sequence;
- a single character class followed by '+', which matches 1 or more
  repetitions of characters in the class. These repetition items will always
  match the longest possible sequence;
- a single character class followed by '-', which also matches 0 or more
  repetitions of characters in the class. Unlike '*', these repetition items
  will always match the shortest possible sequence;
- a single character class followed by '?', which matches 0 or 1 occurrence of
  a character in the class;
- %n, for n between 1 and 9; such item matches a substring equal to the n-th
  captured string (see below);
- %bxy, where x and y are two distinct characters; such item matches strings
  that start with x, end with y, and where the x and y are balanced. This
  means that, if one reads the string from left to right, counting +1 for an x
  and -1 for a y, the ending y is the first y where the count reaches 0. For
  instance, the item %b() matches expressions with balanced parentheses.
- %f[set], a frontier pattern; such item matches an empty string at any
  position such that the next character belongs to set and the previous
  character does not belong to set. The set set is interpreted as previously
  described. The beginning and the end of the subject are handled as if they
  were the character '\0'.
Pattern:
A pattern is a sequence of pattern items. A caret '^' at the beginning of a
pattern anchors the match at the beginning of the subject string. A '$' at the
end of a pattern anchors the match at the end of the subject string. At other
positions, '^' and '$' have no special meaning and represent themselves.
Captures:
A pattern can contain sub-patterns enclosed in parentheses; they describe
captures. When a match succeeds, the substrings of the subject string that
match captures are stored (captured) for future use. Captures are numbered
according to their left parentheses. For instance, in the pattern
"(a*(.)%w(%s*))", the part of the string matching "a*(.)%w(%s*)" is stored as
the first capture (and therefore has number 1); the character matching "." is
captured with number 2, and the part matching "%s*" has number 3.
As a special case, the empty capture () captures the current string position
(a number). For instance, if we apply the pattern "()aa()" on the string
"flaaap", there will be two captures: 3 and 5.

6.5  Table Manipulation                                         *lua52-sec6.5*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library provides generic functions for table manipulation. It provides
all its functions inside the table table.
Remember that, whenever an operation needs the length of a table, the table
should be a proper sequence or have a __len metamethod (see |lua52-sec3.4.6|).
All functions ignore non-numeric keys in tables given as arguments.
For performance reasons, all table accesses (get/set) performed by these
functions are raw.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua52-table.concat*
table.concat (list [, sep [, i [, j]]]) ~

Given a list where all elements are strings or numbers, returns the string
list[i]..sep..list[i+1] ... sep..list[j]. The default value for sep is the
empty string, the default for i is 1, and the default for j is #list. If i is
greater than j, returns the empty string.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua52-table.insert*
table.insert (list, [pos,] value) ~

Inserts element value at position pos in list, shifting up the elements
list[pos], list[pos+1], ..., list[#list]. The default value for pos is
#list+1, so that a call table.insert(t,x) inserts x at the end of list t.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua52-table.pack*
table.pack (...) ~

Returns a new table with all parameters stored into keys 1, 2, etc. and with a
field "n" with the total number of parameters. Note that the resulting table
may not be a sequence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua52-table.remove*
table.remove (list [, pos]) ~

Removes from list the element at position pos, returning the value of the
removed element. When pos is an integer between 1 and #list, it shifts down
the elements list[pos+1], list[pos+2], ..., list[#list] and erases element
list[#list]; The index pos can also be 0 when #list is 0, or #list + 1; in
those cases, the function erases the element list[pos].
The default value for pos is #list, so that a call table.remove(t) removes the
last element of list t.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua52-table.sort*
table.sort (list [, comp]) ~

Sorts list elements in a given order, in-place, from list[1] to list[#list].
If comp is given, then it must be a function that receives two list elements
and returns true when the first element must come before the second in the
final order (so that not comp(list[i+1],list[i]) will be true after the sort).
If comp is not given, then the standard Lua operator < is used instead.
The sort algorithm is not stable; that is, elements considered equal by the
given order may have their relative positions changed by the sort.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua52-table.unpack*
table.unpack (list [, i [, j]]) ~

Returns the elements from the given table. This function is equivalent to
>
     return list[i], list[i+1], ..., list[j]
<
By default, i is 1 and j is #list.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.6  Mathematical Functions                                     *lua52-sec6.6*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library is an interface to the standard C math library. It provides all
its functions inside the table math.

                                                              *lua52-math.abs*
math.abs (x) ~

Returns the absolute value of x.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua52-math.acos*

math.asin (x) ~

Returns the arc sine of x (in radians).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua52-math.atan*
math.atan (x) ~

Returns the arc tangent of x (in radians).

math.atan2 (y, x) ~

Returns the arc tangent of y/x (in radians), but uses the signs of both
parameters to find the quadrant of the result. (It also handles correctly the
case of x being zero.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua52-math.ceil*

math.cos (x) ~

Returns the cosine of x (assumed to be in radians).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua52-math.cosh*
math.cosh (x) ~

Returns the hyperbolic cosine of x.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua52-math.deg*

                                                            *lua52-math.floor*
math.floor (x) ~

Returns the largest integer smaller than or equal to x.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

math.frexp (x) ~

Returns m and e such that x = m2e, e is an integer and the absolute value of m
is in the range [0.5, 1) (or zero when x is zero).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua52-math.huge*
math.huge ~

The value HUGE_VAL, a value larger than or equal to any other numerical value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua52-math.ldexp*
math.ldexp (m, e) ~

Returns m2e (e should be an integer).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua52-math.log*
math.log (x [, base]) ~

Returns the logarithm of x in the given base. The default for base is e (so
that the function returns the natural logarithm of x).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua52-math.max*
math.max (x, ...) ~

Returns the maximum value among its arguments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua52-math.min*
math.min (x, ...) ~

Returns the minimum value among its arguments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua52-math.modf*

                                                              *lua52-math.rad*
math.rad (x) ~

Returns the angle x (given in degrees) in radians.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *lua52-math.random*
math.random ([m [, n]]) ~

This function is an interface to the simple pseudo-random generator function
rand provided by Standard C. (No guarantees can be given for its statistical
properties.)
When called without arguments, returns a uniform pseudo-random real number in
the range [0,1). When called with an integer number m, math.random returns a
uniform pseudo-random integer in the range [1, m]. When called with two
integer numbers m and n, math.random returns a uniform pseudo-random integer
in the range [m, n].

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                       *lua52-math.randomseed*
math.randomseed (x) ~

Sets x as the "seed" for the pseudo-random generator: equal seeds produce
equal sequences of numbers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua52-math.sin*
math.sin (x) ~

Returns the sine of x (assumed to be in radians).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua52-math.sinh*
math.sinh (x) ~

Returns the hyperbolic sine of x.

math.sqrt (x) ~

Returns the square root of x. (You can also use the expression x^0.5 to
compute this value.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua52-math.tan*
math.tan (x) ~

Returns the tangent of x (assumed to be in radians).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua52-math.tanh*
math.tanh (x) ~

Returns the hyperbolic tangent of x.

6.7  Bitwise Operations                                         *lua52-sec6.7*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library provides bitwise operations. It provides all its functions inside
the table bit32.
Unless otherwise stated, all functions accept numeric arguments in the range
(-251,+251); each argument is normalized to the remainder of its division by
232 and truncated to an integer (in some unspecified way), so that its final
value falls in the range [0,232 - 1]. Similarly, all results are in the range
[0,232 - 1]. Note that bit32.bnot(0) is 0xFFFFFFFF, which is different from
-1.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                         *lua52-bit32.arshift*
bit32.arshift (x, disp) ~

Returns the number x shifted disp bits to the right. The number disp may be
any representable integer. Negative displacements shift to the left.
This shift operation is what is called arithmetic shift. Vacant bits on the
left are filled with copies of the higher bit of x; vacant bits on the right
are filled with zeros. In particular, displacements with absolute values
higher than 31 result in zero or 0xFFFFFFFF (all original bits are shifted
out).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua52-bit32.band*
bit32.band (...) ~

Returns the bitwise and of its operands.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua52-bit32.bnot*
bit32.bnot (x) ~

Returns the bitwise negation of x. For any integer x, the following identity
holds:
>
     assert(bit32.bnot(x) == (-1 - x) % 2^32)
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua52-bit32.bor*
bit32.bor (...) ~

Returns the bitwise or of its operands.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *lua52-bit32.btest*
bit32.btest (...) ~

Returns a boolean signaling whether the bitwise and of its operands is
different from zero.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua52-bit32.bxor*
bit32.bxor (...) ~

Returns the bitwise exclusive or of its operands.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                         *lua52-bit32.extract*
bit32.extract (n, field [, width]) ~

Returns the unsigned number formed by the bits field to field + width - 1 from
n. Bits are numbered from 0 (least significant) to 31 (most significant). All
accessed bits must be in the range [0, 31].
The default for width is 1.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                         *lua52-bit32.replace*
bit32.replace (n, v, field [, width]) ~

Returns a copy of n with the bits field to field + width - 1 replaced by the
value v. See |lua52-bit32.extract| for details about field and width.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                         *lua52-bit32.lrotate*
bit32.lrotate (x, disp) ~

Returns the number x rotated disp bits to the left. The number disp may be any
representable integer.
For any valid displacement, the following identity holds:
>
     assert(bit32.lrotate(x, disp) == bit32.lrotate(x, disp % 32))
<
In particular, negative displacements rotate to the right.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua52-bit32.lshift*
bit32.lshift (x, disp) ~

Returns the number x shifted disp bits to the left. The number disp may be any
representable integer. Negative displacements shift to the right. In any
direction, vacant bits are filled with zeros. In particular, displacements
with absolute values higher than 31 result in zero (all bits are shifted out).
For positive displacements, the following equality holds:
>
     assert(bit32.lshift(b, disp) == (b * 2^disp) % 2^32)
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                         *lua52-bit32.rrotate*
bit32.rrotate (x, disp) ~

Returns the number x rotated disp bits to the right. The number disp may be
any representable integer.
For any valid displacement, the following identity holds:
>
     assert(bit32.rrotate(x, disp) == bit32.rrotate(x, disp % 32))
<
In particular, negative displacements rotate to the left.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua52-bit32.rshift*
bit32.rshift (x, disp) ~

Returns the number x shifted disp bits to the right. The number disp may be
any representable integer. Negative displacements shift to the left. In any
direction, vacant bits are filled with zeros. In particular, displacements
with absolute values higher than 31 result in zero (all bits are shifted out).
For positive displacements, the following equality holds:
>
     assert(bit32.rshift(b, disp) == math.floor(b % 2^32 / 2^disp))
<
This shift operation is what is called logical shift.

6.8  Input and Output Facilities                                *lua52-sec6.8*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              *lua52-io.stdin*
                                                             *lua52-io.stdout*
                                                             *lua52-io.stderr*

The I/O library provides two different styles for file manipulation. The first
one uses implicit file descriptors; that is, there are operations to set a
default input file and a default output file, and all input/output operations
are over these default files. The second style uses explicit file descriptors.
When using implicit file descriptors, all operations are supplied by table io.
When using explicit file descriptors, the operation |lua52-io.open| returns a
file descriptor and then all operations are supplied as methods of the file
descriptor.
The table io also provides three predefined file descriptors with their usual
meanings from C: io.stdin, io.stdout, and io.stderr. The I/O library never
closes these files.
Unless otherwise stated, all I/O functions return nil on failure (plus an
error message as a second result and a system-dependent error code as a third
result) and some value different from nil on success. On non-Posix systems,
the computation of the error message and error code in case of errors may be
not thread safe, because they rely on the global C variable errno.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua52-io.close*
io.close ([file]) ~

Equivalent to file:close(). Without a file, closes the default output file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua52-io.flush*
io.flush () ~

Equivalent to io.output():flush().

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua52-io.input*
io.input ([file]) ~

When called with a file name, it opens the named file (in text mode), and sets
its handle as the default input file. When called with a file handle, it
simply sets this file handle as the default input file. When called without
parameters, it returns the current default input file.
In case of errors this function raises the error, instead of returning an
error code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua52-io.lines*
io.lines ([filename ...]) ~

Opens the given file name in read mode and returns an iterator function that
works like file:lines(...) over the opened file. When the iterator function
detects the end of file, it returns nil (to finish the loop) and automatically
closes the file.
The call io.lines() (with no file name) is equivalent to io.input():lines();
that is, it iterates over the lines of the default input file. In this case it
does not close the file when the loop ends.
In case of errors this function raises the error, instead of returning an
error code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               *lua52-io.open*
io.open (filename [, mode]) ~

This function opens a file, in the mode specified in the string mode. It
returns a new file handle, or, in case of errors, nil plus an error message.
The mode string can be any of the following:
- "r": read mode (the default);
- "w": write mode;
- "a": append mode;
- "r+": update mode, all previous data is preserved;
- "w+": update mode, all previous data is erased;
- "a+": append update mode, previous data is preserved, writing is only
  allowed at the end of file.
The mode string can also have a 'b' at the end, which is needed in some
systems to open the file in binary mode.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua52-io.output*
io.output ([file]) ~

Similar to |lua52-io.input|, but operates over the default output file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua52-io.popen*
io.popen (prog [, mode]) ~

This function is system dependent and is not available on all platforms.
Starts program prog in a separated process and returns a file handle that you
can use to read data from this program (if mode is "r", the default) or to
write data to this program (if mode is "w").

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               *lua52-io.read*
io.read (...) ~

Equivalent to io.input():read(...).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua52-io.tmpfile*
io.tmpfile () ~

Returns a handle for a temporary file. This file is opened in update mode and
it is automatically removed when the program ends.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               *lua52-io.type*
io.type (obj) ~

Checks whether obj is a valid file handle. Returns the string "file" if obj is
an open file handle, "closed file" if obj is a closed file handle, or nil if
obj is not a file handle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua52-io.write*
io.write (...) ~

Equivalent to io.output():write(...).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua52-file:close*
file:close () ~

Closes file. Note that files are automatically closed when their handles are
garbage collected, but that takes an unpredictable amount of time to happen.
When closing a file handle created with |lua52-io.popen|, |lua52-file:close|
returns the same values returned by |lua52-os.execute|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua52-file:flush*
file:flush () ~

Saves any written data to file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua52-file:lines*
file:lines (...) ~

Returns an iterator function that, each time it is called, reads the file
according to the given formats. When no format is given, uses "*l" as a
default. As an example, the construction
>
     for c in file:lines(1) do body end
<
will iterate over all characters of the file, starting at the current
position. Unlike |lua52-io.lines|, this function does not close the file when
the loop ends.
In case of errors this function raises the error, instead of returning an
error code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua52-file:read*
file:read (...) ~

Reads the file file, according to the given formats, which specify what to
read. For each format, the function returns a string (or a number) with the
characters read, or nil if it cannot read data with the specified format. When
called without formats, it uses a default format that reads the next line (see
below).
The available formats are
- "*n": reads a number; this is the only format that returns a number instead
  of a string.
- "*a": reads the whole file, starting at the current position. On end of
  file, it returns the empty string.
- "*l": reads the next line skipping the end of line, returning nil on end of
  file. This is the default format.
- "*L": reads the next line keeping the end of line (if present), returning
  nil on end of file.
- number: reads a string with up to this number of bytes, returning nil on end
  of file. If number is zero, it reads nothing and returns an empty string, or
  nil on end of file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua52-file:seek*
file:seek ([whence [, offset]]) ~

Sets and gets the file position, measured from the beginning of the file, to
the position given by offset plus a base specified by the string whence, as
follows:
- "set": base is position 0 (beginning of the file);
- "cur": base is current position;
- "end": base is end of file;
In case of success, seek returns the final file position, measured in bytes
from the beginning of the file. If seek fails, it returns nil, plus a string
describing the error.
The default value for whence is "cur", and for offset is 0. Therefore, the
call file:seek() returns the current file position, without changing it; the
call file:seek("set") sets the position to the beginning of the file (and
returns 0); and the call file:seek("end") sets the position to the end of the
file, and returns its size.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua52-file:setvbuf*
file:setvbuf (mode [, size]) ~

Sets the buffering mode for an output file. There are three available modes:
- "no": no buffering; the result of any output operation appears immediately.
- "full": full buffering; output operation is performed only when the buffer
  is full or when you explicitly flush the file (see |lua52-io.flush|).
- "line": line buffering; output is buffered until a newline is output or
  there is any input from some special files (such as a terminal device).
For the last two cases, size specifies the size of the buffer, in bytes. The
default is an appropriate size.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua52-file:write*
file:write (...) ~

Writes the value of each of its arguments to file. The arguments must be
strings or numbers.
In case of success, this function returns file. Otherwise it returns nil plus
a string describing the error.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.9  Operating System Facilities                                *lua52-sec6.9*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library is implemented through table os.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua52-os.clock*
os.clock () ~

Returns an approximation of the amount in seconds of CPU time used by the
program.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               *lua52-os.date*
os.date ([format [, time]]) ~

Returns a string or a table containing date and time, formatted according to
the given string format.
If the time argument is present, this is the time to be formatted (see the
|lua52-os.time| function for a description of this value). Otherwise, date
formats the current time.
If format starts with '!', then the date is formatted in Coordinated Universal
Time. After this optional character, if format is the string "*t", then date
returns a table with the following fields: year (four digits), month (1-12),
day (1-31), hour (0-23), min (0-59), sec (0-61), wday (weekday, Sunday is 1),
yday (day of the year), and isdst (daylight saving flag, a boolean). This last
field may be absent if the information is not available.
If format is not "*t", then date returns the date as a string, formatted
according to the same rules as the ISO C function strftime.
When called without arguments, date returns a reasonable date and time
representation that depends on the host system and on the current locale (that
is, os.date() is equivalent to os.date("%c")).
On non-Posix systems, this function may be not thread safe because of its
reliance on C function gmtime and C function localtime.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *lua52-os.difftime*
os.difftime (t2, t1) ~

Returns the number of seconds from time t1 to time t2. In POSIX, Windows, and
some other systems, this value is exactly t2-t1.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua52-os.execute*
os.execute ([command]) ~

This function is equivalent to the ISO C function system. It passes command to
be executed by an operating system shell. Its first result is true if the
command terminated successfully, or nil otherwise. After this first result the
function returns a string and a number, as follows:
- "exit": the command terminated normally; the following number is the exit
  status of the command.
- "signal": the command was terminated by a signal; the following number is
  the signal that terminated the command.
When called without a command, os.execute returns a boolean that is true if a
shell is available.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               *lua52-os.exit*
os.exit ([code [, close]) ~

Calls the ISO C function exit to terminate the host program. If code is true,
the returned status is EXIT_SUCCESS; if code is false, the returned status is
EXIT_FAILURE; if code is a number, the returned status is this number. The
default value for code is true.
If the optional second argument close is true, closes the Lua state before
exiting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua52-os.getenv*
os.getenv (varname) ~

Returns the value of the process environment variable varname, or nil if the
variable is not defined.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua52-os.remove*
os.remove (filename) ~

Deletes the file (or empty directory, on POSIX systems) with the given name.
If this function fails, it returns nil, plus a string describing the error and
the error code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua52-os.rename*
os.rename (oldname, newname) ~

Renames file or directory named oldname to newname. If this function fails, it
returns nil, plus a string describing the error and the error code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua52-os.setlocale*
os.setlocale (locale [, category]) ~

Sets the current locale of the program. locale is a system-dependent string
specifying a locale; category is an optional string describing which category
to change: "all", "collate", "ctype", "monetary", "numeric", or "time"; the
default category is "all". The function returns the name of the new locale, or
nil if the request cannot be honored.
If locale is the empty string, the current locale is set to an
implementation-defined native locale. If locale is the string "C", the current
locale is set to the standard C locale.
When called with nil as the first argument, this function only returns the
name of the current locale for the given category.
This function may be not thread safe because of its reliance on C function
setlocale.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               *lua52-os.time*
os.time ([table]) ~

Returns the current time when called without arguments, or a time representing
the date and time specified by the given table. This table must have fields
year, month, and day, and may have fields hour (default is 12), min (default
is 0), sec (default is 0), and isdst (default is nil). For a description of
these fields, see the |lua52-os.date| function.
The returned value is a number, whose meaning depends on your system. In
POSIX, Windows, and some other systems, this number counts the number of
seconds since some given start time (the "epoch"). In other systems, the
meaning is not specified, and the number returned by time can be used only as
an argument to |lua52-os.date| and |lua52-os.difftime|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua52-os.tmpname*
os.tmpname () ~

Returns a string with a file name that can be used for a temporary file. The
file must be explicitly opened before its use and explicitly removed when no
longer needed.
On POSIX systems, this function also creates a file with that name, to avoid
security risks. (Someone else might create the file with wrong permissions in
the time between getting the name and creating the file.) You still have to
open the file to use it and to remove it (even if you do not use it).
When possible, you may prefer to use |lua52-io.tmpfile|, which automatically
removes the file when the program ends.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.10  The Debug Library                                        *lua52-sec6.10*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library provides the functionality of the debug interface
(|lua52-sec4.9|) to Lua programs. You should exert care when using this
library. Several of its functions violate basic assumptions about Lua code
(e.g., that variables local to a function cannot be accessed from outside;
that userdata metatables cannot be changed by Lua code; that Lua programs do
not crash) and therefore can compromise otherwise secure code. Moreover, some
functions in this library may be slow.
All functions in this library are provided inside the debug table. All
functions that operate over a thread have an optional first argument which is
the thread to operate over. The default is always the current thread.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *lua52-debug.debug*
debug.debug () ~

Enters an interactive mode with the user, running each string that the user
enters. Using simple commands and other debug facilities, the user can inspect
global and local variables, change their values, evaluate expressions, and so
on. A line containing only the word cont finishes this function, so that the
caller continues its execution.
Note that commands for debug.debug are not lexically nested within any
function and so have no direct access to local variables.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                         *lua52-debug.gethook*
debug.gethook ([thread]) ~

Returns the current hook settings of the thread, as three values: the current
hook function, the current hook mask, and the current hook count (as set by
the |lua52-debug.sethook| function).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                         *lua52-debug.getinfo*
debug.getinfo ([thread,] f [, what]) ~

Returns a table with information about a function. You can give the function
directly or you can give a number as the value of f, which means the function
running at level f of the call stack of the given thread: level 0 is the
current function (getinfo itself); level 1 is the function that called getinfo
(except for tail calls, which do not count on the stack); and so on. If f is a
number larger than the number of active functions, then getinfo returns nil.
The returned table can contain all the fields returned by |lua52-lua_getinfo|,
with the string what describing which fields to fill in. The default for what
is to get all information available, except the table of valid lines. If
present, the option 'f' adds a field named func with the function itself. If
present, the option 'L' adds a field named activelines with the table of valid
lines.
For instance, the expression debug.getinfo(1,"n").name returns a table with a
name for the current function, if a reasonable name can be found, and the
expression debug.getinfo(print) returns a table with all available information
about the |lua52-print| function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                        *lua52-debug.getlocal*
debug.getlocal ([thread,] f, local) ~

This function returns the name and the value of the local variable with index
local of the function at level f of the stack. This function accesses not only
explicit local variables, but also parameters, temporaries, etc.
The first parameter or local variable has index 1, and so on, until the last
active variable. Negative indices refer to vararg parameters; -1 is the first
vararg parameter. The function returns nil if there is no variable with the
given index, and raises an error when called with a level out of range. (You
can call |lua52-debug.getinfo| to check whether the level is valid.)
Variable names starting with '(' (open parenthesis) represent internal
variables (loop control variables, temporaries, varargs, and C function
locals).
The parameter f may also be a function. In that case, getlocal returns only
the name of function parameters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                    *lua52-debug.getmetatable*
debug.getmetatable (value) ~

Returns the metatable of the given value or nil if it does not have a
metatable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                     *lua52-debug.getregistry*
debug.getregistry () ~

Returns the registry table (see |lua52-sec4.5|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                      *lua52-debug.getupvalue*
debug.getupvalue (f, up) ~

This function returns the name and the value of the upvalue with index up of
the function f. The function returns nil if there is no upvalue with the given
index.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                    *lua52-debug.getuservalue*
debug.getuservalue (u) ~

Returns the Lua value associated to u. If u is not a userdata, returns nil.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                         *lua52-debug.sethook*
debug.sethook ([thread,] hook, mask [, count]) ~

Sets the given function as a hook. The string mask and the number count
describe when the hook will be called. The string mask may have any
combination of the following characters, with the given meaning:
- 'c': the hook is called every time Lua calls a function;
- 'r': the hook is called every time Lua returns from a function;
- 'l': the hook is called every time Lua enters a new line of code.
Moreover, with a count different from zero, the hook is called also after
every count instructions.
When called without arguments, |lua52-debug.sethook| turns off the hook.
When the hook is called, its first parameter is a string describing the event
that has triggered its call: "call" (or "tail call"), "return", "line", and
"count". For line events, the hook also gets the new line number as its second
parameter. Inside a hook, you can call getinfo with level 2 to get more
information about the running function (level 0 is the getinfo function, and
level 1 is the hook function).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                        *lua52-debug.setlocal*
debug.setlocal ([thread,] level, local, value) ~

This function assigns the value value to the local variable with index local
of the function at level level of the stack. The function returns nil if there
is no local variable with the given index, and raises an error when called
with a level out of range. (You can call getinfo to check whether the level is
valid.) Otherwise, it returns the name of the local variable.
See |lua52-debug.getlocal| for more information about variable indices and
names.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                    *lua52-debug.setmetatable*
debug.setmetatable (value, table) ~

Sets the metatable for the given value to the given table (which can be nil).
Returns value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                      *lua52-debug.setupvalue*
debug.setupvalue (f, up, value) ~

This function assigns the value value to the upvalue with index up of the
function f. The function returns nil if there is no upvalue with the given
index. Otherwise, it returns the name of the upvalue.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                    *lua52-debug.setuservalue*
debug.setuservalue (udata, value) ~

Sets the given value as the Lua value associated to the given udata. value
must be a table or nil; udata must be a full userdata.
Returns udata.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                       *lua52-debug.traceback*
debug.traceback ([thread,] [message [, level]]) ~

If message is present but is neither a string nor nil, this function returns
message without further processing. Otherwise, it returns a string with a
traceback of the call stack. An optional message string is appended at the
beginning of the traceback. An optional level number tells at which level to
start the traceback (default is 1, the function calling traceback).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                       *lua52-debug.upvalueid*
debug.upvalueid (f, n) ~

Returns an unique identifier (as a light userdata) for the upvalue numbered n
from the given function.
These unique identifiers allow a program to check whether different closures
share upvalues. Lua closures that share an upvalue (that is, that access a
same external local variable) will return identical ids for those upvalue
indices.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                     *lua52-debug.upvaluejoin*
debug.upvaluejoin (f1, n1, f2, n2) ~

Make the n1-th upvalue of the Lua closure f1 refer to the n2-th upvalue of the
Lua closure f2.

7.  Lua Standalone                                                *lua52-sec7*
==============================================================================
                                                          *lua52-LUA_INIT_5_2*
                                                              *lua52-LUA_INIT*

Although Lua has been designed as an extension language, to be embedded in a
host C program, it is also frequently used as a standalone language. An
interpreter for Lua as a standalone language, called simply lua, is provided
with the standard distribution. The standalone interpreter includes all
standard libraries, including the debug library. Its usage is:
>
     lua [options] [script [args]]
<
The options are:
- -e stat: executes string stat;
- -l mod: "requires" mod;
- -i: enters interactive mode after running script;
- -v: prints version information;
- -E: ignores environment variables;
- --: stops handling options;
- -: executes stdin as a file and stops handling options.
After handling its options, lua runs the given script, passing to it the given
args as string arguments. When called without arguments, lua behaves as lua -v
-i when the standard input (stdin) is a terminal, and as lua - otherwise.
When called without option -E, the interpreter checks for an environment
variable LUA_INIT_5_2 (or LUA_INIT if it is not defined) before running any
argument. If the variable content has the format @filename, then lua executes
the file. Otherwise, lua executes the string itself.
When called with option -E, besides ignoring LUA_INIT, Lua also ignores the
values of LUA_PATH and LUA_CPATH, setting the values of |lua52-package.path|
and |lua52-package.cpath| with the default paths defined in luaconf.h.
All options are handled in order, except -i and -E. For instance, an
invocation like
>
     $ lua -e'a=1' -e 'print(a)' script.lua
<
will first set a to 1, then print the value of a, and finally run the file
script.lua with no arguments. (Here $ is the shell prompt. Your prompt may be
different.)
Before starting to run the script, lua collects all arguments in the command
line in a global table called arg. The script name is stored at index 0, the
first argument after the script name goes to index 1, and so on. Any arguments
before the script name (that is, the interpreter name plus the options) go to
negative indices. For instance, in the call
>
     $ lua -la b.lua t1 t2
<
the interpreter first runs the file a.lua, then creates a table
>
     arg = { [-2] = "lua", [-1] = "-la",
             [0] = "b.lua",
             [1] = "t1", [2] = "t2" }
<
and finally runs the file b.lua. The script is called with arg[1], arg[2], ...
as arguments; it can also access these arguments with the vararg expression
'...'.
In interactive mode, if you write an incomplete statement, the interpreter
waits for its completion by issuing a different prompt.
In case of unprotected errors in the script, the interpreter reports the error
to the standard error stream. If the error object is a string, the interpreter
adds a stack traceback to it. Otherwise, if the error object has a metamethod
__tostring, the interpreter calls this metamethod to produce the final
message. Finally, if the error object is nil, the interpreter does not report
the error.
When finishing normally, the interpreter closes its main Lua state (see
|lua52-lua_close|). The script can avoid this step by calling |lua52-os.exit|
to terminate.
To allow the use of Lua as a script interpreter in Unix systems, the
standalone interpreter skips the first line of a chunk if it starts with #.
Therefore, Lua scripts can be made into executable programs by using chmod +x
and the #! form, as in
>
     #!/usr/local/bin/lua
<
(Of course, the location of the Lua interpreter may be different in your
machine. If lua is in your PATH, then
>
     #!/usr/bin/env lua
<
is a more portable solution.)

==============================================================================
8.  Incompatibilities with the Previous Version                   *lua52-sec8*
==============================================================================

Here we list the incompatibilities that you may find when moving a program
from Lua 5.1 to Lua 5.2. You can avoid some incompatibilities by compiling Lua
with appropriate options (see file luaconf.h). However, all these
compatibility options will be removed in the next version of Lua. Similarly,
all features marked as deprecated in Lua 5.1 have been removed in Lua 5.2.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.1  Changes in the Language                                    *lua52-sec8.1*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The concept of environment changed. Only Lua functions have environments. To
  set the environment of a Lua function, use the variable _ENV or the function
  |lua52-load|.
  C functions no longer have environments. Use an upvalue with a shared table
  if you need to keep shared state among several C functions. (You may use
  |lua52-luaL_setfuncs| to open a C library with all functions sharing a
  common upvalue.)
  To manipulate the "environment" of a userdata (which is now called user
  value), use the new functions |lua52-lua_getuservalue| and
  |lua52-lua_setuservalue|.
- Lua identifiers cannot use locale-dependent letters.
- Doing a step or a full collection in the garbage collector does not restart
  the collector if it has been stopped.
- Weak tables with weak keys now perform like ephemeron tables.
- The event tail return in debug hooks was removed. Instead, tail calls
  generate a special new event, tail call, so that the debugger can know that
  there will not be a corresponding return event.
- Equality between function values has changed. Now, a function definition may
  not create a new value; it may reuse some previous value if there is no
  observable difference to the new function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.2  Changes in the Libraries                                   *lua52-sec8.2*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Function module is deprecated. It is easy to set up a module with regular
  Lua code. Modules are not expected to set global variables.
- Functions setfenv and getfenv were removed, because of the changes in
  environments.
- Function math.log10 is deprecated. Use |lua52-math.log| with 10 as its
  second argument, instead.
- Function loadstring is deprecated. Use load instead; it now accepts string
  arguments and are exactly equivalent to loadstring.
- Function table.maxn is deprecated. Write it in Lua if you really need it.
- Function os.execute now returns true when command terminates successfully
  and nil plus error information otherwise.
- Function unpack was moved into the table library and therefore must be
  called as |lua52-table.unpack|.
- Character class %z in patterns is deprecated, as now patterns may contain
  '\0' as a regular character.
- The table package.loaders was renamed package.searchers.
- Lua does not have bytecode verification anymore. So, all functions that load
  code (|lua52-load| and |lua52-loadfile|) are potentially insecure when
  loading untrusted binary data. (Actually, those functions were already
  insecure because of flaws in the verification algorithm.) When in doubt, use
  the mode argument of those functions to restrict them to loading textual
  chunks.
- The standard paths in the official distribution may change between versions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.3  Changes in the API                                         *lua52-sec8.3*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Pseudoindex LUA_GLOBALSINDEX was removed. You must get the global
  environment from the registry (see |lua52-sec4.5|).
- Pseudoindex LUA_ENVIRONINDEX and functions lua_getfenv/lua_setfenv were
  removed, as C functions no longer have environments.
- Function luaL_register is deprecated. Use |lua52-luaL_setfuncs| so that your
  module does not create globals. (Modules are not expected to set global
  variables anymore.)
- The osize argument to the allocation function may not be zero when creating
  a new block, that is, when ptr is NULL (see |lua52-lua_Alloc|). Use only the
  test ptr == NULL to check whether the block is new.
- Finalizers (__gc metamethods) for userdata are called in the reverse order
  that they were marked for finalization, not that they were created (see
  |lua52-sec2.5.1|). (Most userdata are marked immediately after they are
  created.) Moreover, if the metatable does not have a __gc field when set,
  the finalizer will not be called, even if it is set later.
- luaL_typerror was removed. Write your own version if you need it.
- Function lua_cpcall is deprecated. You can simply push the function with
  |lua52-lua_pushcfunction| and call it with |lua52-lua_pcall|.
- Functions lua_equal and lua_lessthan are deprecated. Use the new
  |lua52-lua_compare| with appropriate options instead.
- Function lua_objlen was renamed |lua52-lua_rawlen|.
- Function |lua52-lua_load| has an extra parameter, mode. Pass NULL to
  simulate the old behavior.
- Function |lua52-lua_resume| has an extra parameter, from. Pass NULL or the
  thread doing the call.
