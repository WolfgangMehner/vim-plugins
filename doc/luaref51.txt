1.  Introduction                                                  *lua51-sec1*
==============================================================================

Lua is an extension programming language designed to support general
procedural programming with data description facilities. It also offers good
support for object-oriented programming, functional programming, and
data-driven programming. Lua is intended to be used as a powerful,
light-weight scripting language for any program that needs one. Lua is
implemented as a library, written in clean C (that is, in the common subset of
ANSI C and C++).
Being an extension language, Lua has no notion of a "main" program: it only
works embedded in a host client, called the embedding program or simply the
host. This host program can invoke functions to execute a piece of Lua code,
can write and read Lua variables, and can register C functions to be called by
Lua code. Through the use of C functions, Lua can be augmented to cope with a
wide range of different domains, thus creating customized programming
languages sharing a syntactical framework. The Lua distribution includes a
sample host program called lua, which uses the Lua library to offer a
complete, stand-alone Lua interpreter.
Lua is free software, and is provided as usual with no guarantees, as stated
in its license. The implementation described in this manual is available at
Lua's official web site, www.lua.org.
Like any other reference manual, this document is dry in places. For a
discussion of the decisions behind the design of Lua, see the technical papers
available at Lua's web site. For a detailed introduction to programming in
Lua, see Roberto's book, Programming in Lua (Second Edition).

==============================================================================
2.  The Language                                                  *lua51-sec2*
==============================================================================

This section describes the lexis, the syntax, and the semantics of Lua. In
other words, this section describes which tokens are valid, how they can be
combined, and what their combinations mean.
The language constructs will be explained using the usual extended BNF
notation, in which {a} means 0 or more a's, and [a] means an optional a.
Non-terminals are shown like non-terminal, keywords are shown like kword, and
other terminal symbols are shown like `=´. The complete syntax of Lua can be
found in |lua51-sec8| at the end of this manual.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1  Lexical Conventions                                        *lua51-sec2.1*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Names (also called identifiers) in Lua can be any string of letters, digits,
and underscores, not beginning with a digit. This coincides with the
definition of names in most languages. (The definition of letter depends on
the current locale: any character considered alphabetic by the current locale
can be used in an identifier.) Identifiers are used to name variables and
table fields.
The following keywords are reserved and cannot be used as names:
>
     and       break     do        else      elseif
     end       false     for       function  if
     in        local     nil       not       or
     repeat    return    then      true      until     while
<
Lua is a case-sensitive language: and is a reserved word, but And and AND are
two different, valid names. As a convention, names starting with an underscore
followed by uppercase letters (such as |lua51-_VERSION|) are reserved for
internal global variables used by Lua.
The following strings denote other tokens:
>
     +     -     *     /     %     ^     #
     ==    ~=    <=    >=    <     >     =
     (     )     {     }     [     ]
     ;     :     ,     .     ..    ...
<
Literal strings can be delimited by matching single or double quotes, and can
contain the following C-like escape sequences: '\a' (bell), '\b' (backspace),
'\f' (form feed), '\n' (newline), '\r' (carriage return), '\t' (horizontal
tab), '\v' (vertical tab), '\\' (backslash), '\"' (quotation mark [double
quote]), and '\'' (apostrophe [single quote]). Moreover, a backslash followed
by a real newline results in a newline in the string. A character in a string
can also be specified by its numerical value using the escape sequence \ddd,
where ddd is a sequence of up to three decimal digits. (Note that if a
numerical escape is to be followed by a digit, it must be expressed using
exactly three digits.) Strings in Lua can contain any 8-bit value, including
embedded zeros, which can be specified as '\0'.
Literal strings can also be defined using a long format enclosed by long
brackets. We define an opening long bracket of level n as an opening square
bracket followed by n equal signs followed by another opening square bracket.
So, an opening long bracket of level 0 is written as [[, an opening long
bracket of level 1 is written as [=[, and so on. A closing long bracket is
defined similarly; for instance, a closing long bracket of level 4 is written
as ]====]. A long string starts with an opening long bracket of any level and
ends at the first closing long bracket of the same level. Literals in this
bracketed form can run for several lines, do not interpret any escape
sequences, and ignore long brackets of any other level. They can contain
anything except a closing bracket of the proper level.
For convenience, when the opening long bracket is immediately followed by a
newline, the newline is not included in the string. As an example, in a system
using ASCII (in which 'a' is coded as 97, newline is coded as 10, and '1' is
coded as 49), the five literal strings below denote the same string:
>
     a = 'alo\n123"'
     a = "alo\n123\""
     a = '\97lo\10\04923"'
     a = [[alo
     123"]]
     a = [==[
     alo
     123"]==]
<
A numerical constant can be written with an optional decimal part and an
optional decimal exponent. Lua also accepts integer hexadecimal constants, by
prefixing them with 0x. Examples of valid numerical constants are
>
     3   3.0   3.1416   314.16e-2   0.31416E1   0xff   0x56
<
A comment starts with a double hyphen (--) anywhere outside a string. If the
text immediately after -- is not an opening long bracket, the comment is a
short comment, which runs until the end of the line. Otherwise, it is a long
comment, which runs until the corresponding closing long bracket. Long
comments are frequently used to disable code temporarily.

2.2  Values and Types                                           *lua51-sec2.2*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua is a dynamically typed language. This means that variables do not have
types; only values do. There are no type definitions in the language. All
values carry their own type.
All values in Lua are first-class values. This means that all values can be
stored in variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as
results.
There are eight basic types in Lua: nil, boolean, number, string, function,
userdata, thread, and table. Nil is the type of the value nil, whose main
property is to be different from any other value; it usually represents the
absence of a useful value. Boolean is the type of the values false and true.
Both nil and false make a condition false; any other value makes it true.
Number represents real (double-precision floating-point) numbers. (It is easy
to build Lua interpreters that use other internal representations for numbers,
such as single-precision float or long integers; see file luaconf.h.) String
represents arrays of characters. Lua is 8-bit clean: strings can contain any
8-bit character, including embedded zeros ('\0') (see |lua51-sec2.1|).
Lua can call (and manipulate) functions written in Lua and functions written
in C (see |lua51-sec2.5.8|).
The type userdata is provided to allow arbitrary C data to be stored in Lua
variables. This type corresponds to a block of raw memory and has no
pre-defined operations in Lua, except assignment and identity test. However,
by using metatables, the programmer can define operations for userdata values
(see |lua51-sec2.8|). Userdata values cannot be created or modified in Lua,
only through the C API. This guarantees the integrity of data owned by the
host program.
The type thread represents independent threads of execution and it is used to
implement coroutines (see |lua51-sec2.11|). Do not confuse Lua threads with
operating-system threads. Lua supports coroutines on all systems, even those
that do not support threads.
The type table implements associative arrays, that is, arrays that can be
indexed not only with numbers, but with any value (except nil). Tables can be
heterogeneous; that is, they can contain values of all types (except nil).
Tables are the sole data structuring mechanism in Lua; they can be used to
represent ordinary arrays, symbol tables, sets, records, graphs, trees, etc.
To represent records, Lua uses the field name as an index. The language
supports this representation by providing a.name as syntactic sugar for
a["name"]. There are several convenient ways to create tables in Lua (see
|lua51-sec2.5.7|).
Like indices, the value of a table field can be of any type (except nil). In
particular, because functions are first-class values, table fields can contain
functions. Thus tables can also carry methods (see |lua51-sec2.5.9|).
Tables, functions, threads, and (full) userdata values are objects: variables
do not actually contain these values, only references to them. Assignment,
parameter passing, and function returns always manipulate references to such
values; these operations do not imply any kind of copy.
The library function |lua51-type| returns a string describing the type of a
given value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2.1  Coercion                                               *lua51-sec2.2.1*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua provides automatic conversion between string and number values at run
time. Any arithmetic operation applied to a string tries to convert this
string to a number, following the usual conversion rules. Conversely, whenever
a number is used where a string is expected, the number is converted to a
string, in a reasonable format. For complete control over how numbers are
converted to strings, use the format function from the string library (see
|lua51-string.format|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3  Variables                                                  *lua51-sec2.3*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Variables are places that store values. There are three kinds of variables in
Lua: global variables, local variables, and table fields.
A single name can denote a global variable or a local variable (or a
function's formal parameter, which is a particular kind of local variable):
>
	var ::= Name
<
Name denotes identifiers, as defined in |lua51-sec2.1|.
Any variable is assumed to be global unless explicitly declared as a local
(see |lua51-sec2.4.7|). Local variables are lexically scoped: local variables
can be freely accessed by functions defined inside their scope (see
|lua51-sec2.6|).
Before the first assignment to a variable, its value is nil.
Square brackets are used to index a table:
>
	var ::= prefixexp `[´ exp `]´
<
The meaning of accesses to global variables and table fields can be changed
via metatables. An access to an indexed variable t[i] is equivalent to a call
gettable_event(t,i). (See |lua51-sec2.8| for a complete description of the
gettable_event function. This function is not defined or callable in Lua. We
use it here only for explanatory purposes.)
The syntax var.Name is just syntactic sugar for var["Name"]:
>
	var ::= prefixexp `.´ Name
<
All global variables live as fields in ordinary Lua tables, called environment
tables or simply environments (see |lua51-sec2.9|). Each function has its own
reference to an environment, so that all global variables in this function
will refer to this environment table. When a function is created, it inherits
the environment from the function that created it. To get the environment
table of a Lua function, you call |lua51-getfenv|. To replace it, you call
|lua51-setfenv|. (You can only manipulate the environment of C functions
through the debug library; (see |lua51-sec5.9|).)
An access to a global variable x is equivalent to _env.x, which in turn is
equivalent to
>
     gettable_event(_env, "x")
<
where _env is the environment of the running function. (See |lua51-sec2.8| for
a complete description of the gettable_event function. This function is not
defined or callable in Lua. Similarly, the _env variable is not defined in
Lua. We use them here only for explanatory purposes.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.4  Statements                                                 *lua51-sec2.4*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua supports an almost conventional set of statements, similar to those in
Pascal or C. This set includes assignments, control structures, function
calls, and variable declarations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.4.1  Chunks                                                 *lua51-sec2.4.1*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The unit of execution of Lua is called a chunk. A chunk is simply a sequence
of statements, which are executed sequentially. Each statement can be
optionally followed by a semicolon:
>
	chunk ::= {stat [`;´]}
<
There are no empty statements and thus ';;' is not legal.
Lua handles a chunk as the body of an anonymous function with a variable
number of arguments (see |lua51-sec2.5.9|). As such, chunks can define local
variables, receive arguments, and return values.
A chunk can be stored in a file or in a string inside the host program. To
execute a chunk, Lua first pre-compiles the chunk into instructions for a
virtual machine, and then it executes the compiled code with an interpreter
for the virtual machine.
Chunks can also be pre-compiled into binary form; see program luac for
details. Programs in source and compiled forms are interchangeable; Lua
automatically detects the file type and acts accordingly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.4.2  Blocks                                                 *lua51-sec2.4.2*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A block is a list of statements; syntactically, a block is the same as a
chunk:
>
	block ::= chunk
<
A block can be explicitly delimited to produce a single statement:
>
	stat ::= do block end
<
Explicit blocks are useful to control the scope of variable declarations.
Explicit blocks are also sometimes used to add a return or break statement in
the middle of another block (see |lua51-sec2.4.4|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.4.3  Assignment                                             *lua51-sec2.4.3*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua allows multiple assignments. Therefore, the syntax for assignment defines
a list of variables on the left side and a list of expressions on the right
side. The elements in both lists are separated by commas:
>
	stat ::= varlist `=´ explist
	varlist ::= var {`,´ var}
	explist ::= exp {`,´ exp}
<
Expressions are discussed in |lua51-sec2.5|.
Before the assignment, the list of values is adjusted to the length of the
list of variables. If there are more values than needed, the excess values are
thrown away. If there are fewer values than needed, the list is extended with
as many nil's as needed. If the list of expressions ends with a function call,
then all values returned by that call enter the list of values, before the
adjustment (except when the call is enclosed in parentheses; see
|lua51-sec2.5|).
The assignment statement first evaluates all its expressions and only then are
the assignments performed. Thus the code
>
     i = 3
     i, a[i] = i+1, 20
<
sets a[3] to 20, without affecting a[4] because the i in a[i] is evaluated (to
3) before it is assigned 4. Similarly, the line
>
     x, y = y, x
<
exchanges the values of x and y, and
>
     x, y, z = y, z, x
<
cyclically permutes the values of x, y, and z.
The meaning of assignments to global variables and table fields can be changed
via metatables. An assignment to an indexed variable t[i] = val is equivalent
to settable_event(t,i,val). (See |lua51-sec2.8| for a complete description of
the settable_event function. This function is not defined or callable in Lua.
We use it here only for explanatory purposes.)
An assignment to a global variable x = val is equivalent to the assignment
_env.x = val, which in turn is equivalent to
>
     settable_event(_env, "x", val)
<
where _env is the environment of the running function. (The _env variable is
not defined in Lua. We use it here only for explanatory purposes.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.4.4  Control Structures                                     *lua51-sec2.4.4*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The control structures if, while, and repeat have the usual meaning and
familiar syntax:
>
	stat ::= while exp do block end
	stat ::= repeat block until exp
	stat ::= if exp then block {elseif exp then block} [else block] end
<
Lua also has a for statement, in two flavors (see |lua51-sec2.4.5|).
The condition expression of a control structure can return any value. Both
false and nil are considered false. All values different from nil and false
are considered true (in particular, the number 0 and the empty string are also
true).
In the repeat-until loop, the inner block does not end at the until keyword,
but only after the condition. So, the condition can refer to local variables
declared inside the loop block.
The return statement is used to return values from a function or a chunk
(which is just a function). Functions and chunks can return more than one
value, and so the syntax for the return statement is
>
	stat ::= return [explist]
<
The break statement is used to terminate the execution of a while, repeat, or
for loop, skipping to the next statement after the loop:
>
	stat ::= break
<
A break ends the innermost enclosing loop.
The return and break statements can only be written as the last statement of a
block. If it is really necessary to return or break in the middle of a block,
then an explicit inner block can be used, as in the idioms do return end and
do break end, because now return and break are the last statements in their
(inner) blocks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.4.5  For Statement                                          *lua51-sec2.4.5*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The for statement has two forms: one numeric and one generic.
The numeric for loop repeats a block of code while a control variable runs
through an arithmetic progression. It has the following syntax:
>
	stat ::= for Name `=´ exp `,´ exp [`,´ exp] do block end
<
The block is repeated for name starting at the value of the first exp, until
it passes the second exp by steps of the third exp. More precisely, a for
statement like
>
     for v = e1, e2, e3 do block end
<
is equivalent to the code:
>
     do
       local var, limit, step = tonumber(e1), tonumber(e2), tonumber(e3)
       if not (var and limit and step) then error() end
       while (step > 0 and var <= limit) or (step <= 0 and var >= limit) do
         local v = var
         block
         var = var + step
       end
     end
<
Note the following:
- All three control expressions are evaluated only once, before the loop
  starts. They must all result in numbers.
- var, limit, and step are invisible variables. The names shown here are for
  explanatory purposes only.
- If the third expression (the step) is absent, then a step of 1 is used.
- You can use break to exit a for loop.
- The loop variable v is local to the loop; you cannot use its value after the
  for ends or is broken. If you need this value, assign it to another variable
  before breaking or exiting the loop.
The generic for statement works over functions, called iterators. On each
iteration, the iterator function is called to produce a new value, stopping
when this new value is nil. The generic for loop has the following syntax:
>
	stat ::= for namelist in explist do block end
	namelist ::= Name {`,´ Name}
<
A for statement like
>
     for var_1, ..., var_n in explist do block end
<
is equivalent to the code:
>
     do
       local f, s, var = explist
       while true do
         local var_1, ..., var_n = f(s, var)
         var = var_1
         if var == nil then break end
         block
       end
     end
<
Note the following:
- explist is evaluated only once. Its results are an iterator function, a
  state, and an initial value for the first iterator variable.
- f, s, and var are invisible variables. The names are here for explanatory
  purposes only.
- You can use break to exit a for loop.
- The loop variables var_i are local to the loop; you cannot use their values
  after the for ends. If you need these values, then assign them to other
  variables before breaking or exiting the loop.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.4.6  Function Calls as Statements                           *lua51-sec2.4.6*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To allow possible side-effects, function calls can be executed as statements:
>
	stat ::= functioncall
<
In this case, all returned values are thrown away. Function calls are
explained in |lua51-sec2.5.8|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.4.7  Local Declarations                                     *lua51-sec2.4.7*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Local variables can be declared anywhere inside a block. The declaration can
include an initial assignment:
>
	stat ::= local namelist [`=´ explist]
<
If present, an initial assignment has the same semantics of a multiple
assignment (see |lua51-sec2.4.3|). Otherwise, all variables are initialized
with nil.
A chunk is also a block (see |lua51-sec2.4.1|), and so local variables can be
declared in a chunk outside any explicit block. The scope of such local
variables extends until the end of the chunk.
The visibility rules for local variables are explained in |lua51-sec2.6|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.5  Expressions                                                *lua51-sec2.5*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The basic expressions in Lua are the following:
>
	exp ::= prefixexp
	exp ::= nil | false | true
	exp ::= Number
	exp ::= String
	exp ::= function
	exp ::= tableconstructor
	exp ::= `...´
	exp ::= exp binop exp
	exp ::= unop exp
	prefixexp ::= var | functioncall | `(´ exp `)´
<
Numbers and literal strings are explained in |lua51-sec2.1|; variables are
explained in |lua51-sec2.3|; function definitions are explained in
|lua51-sec2.5.9|; function calls are explained in |lua51-sec2.5.8|; table
constructors are explained in |lua51-sec2.5.7|. Vararg expressions, denoted by
three dots ('...'), can only be used when directly inside a vararg function;
they are explained in |lua51-sec2.5.9|.
Binary operators comprise arithmetic operators (see |lua51-sec2.5.1|),
relational operators (see |lua51-sec2.5.2|), logical operators (see
|lua51-sec2.5.3|), and the concatenation operator (see |lua51-sec2.5.4|).
Unary operators comprise the unary minus (see |lua51-sec2.5.1|), the unary not
(see |lua51-sec2.5.3|), and the unary length operator (see |lua51-sec2.5.5|).
Both function calls and vararg expressions can result in multiple values. If
an expression is used as a statement (only possible for function calls (see
|lua51-sec2.4.6|)), then its return list is adjusted to zero elements, thus
discarding all returned values. If an expression is used as the last (or the
only) element of a list of expressions, then no adjustment is made (unless the
call is enclosed in parentheses). In all other contexts, Lua adjusts the
result list to one element, discarding all values except the first one.
Here are some examples:
>
     f()                -- adjusted to 0 results
     g(f(), x)          -- f() is adjusted to 1 result
     g(x, f())          -- g gets x plus all results from f()
     a,b,c = f(), x     -- f() is adjusted to 1 result (c gets nil)
     a,b = ...          -- a gets the first vararg parameter, b gets
                        -- the second (both a and b can get nil if there
                        -- is no corresponding vararg parameter)
     
     a,b,c = x, f()     -- f() is adjusted to 2 results
     a,b,c = f()        -- f() is adjusted to 3 results
     return f()         -- returns all results from f()
     return ...         -- returns all received vararg parameters
     return x,y,f()     -- returns x, y, and all results from f()
     {f()}              -- creates a list with all results from f()
     {...}              -- creates a list with all vararg parameters
     {f(), nil}         -- f() is adjusted to 1 result
<
Any expression enclosed in parentheses always results in only one value. Thus,
(f(x,y,z)) is always a single value, even if f returns several values. (The
value of (f(x,y,z)) is the first value returned by f or nil if f does not
return any values.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.5.1  Arithmetic Operators                                   *lua51-sec2.5.1*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua supports the usual arithmetic operators: the binary + (addition), -
(subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), % (modulo), and ^
(exponentiation); and unary - (negation). If the operands are numbers, or
strings that can be converted to numbers (see |lua51-sec2.2.1|), then all
operations have the usual meaning. Exponentiation works for any exponent. For
instance, x^(-0.5) computes the inverse of the square root of x. Modulo is
defined as
>
     a % b == a - math.floor(a/b)*b
<
That is, it is the remainder of a division that rounds the quotient towards
minus infinity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.5.2  Relational Operators                                   *lua51-sec2.5.2*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The relational operators in Lua are
>
     ==    ~=    <     >     <=    >=
<
These operators always result in false or true.
Equality (==) first compares the type of its operands. If the types are
different, then the result is false. Otherwise, the values of the operands are
compared. Numbers and strings are compared in the usual way. Objects (tables,
userdata, threads, and functions) are compared by reference: two objects are
considered equal only if they are the same object. Every time you create a new
object (a table, userdata, thread, or function), this new object is different
from any previously existing object.
You can change the way that Lua compares tables and userdata by using the "eq"
metamethod (see |lua51-sec2.8|).
The conversion rules of |lua51-sec2.2.1| do not apply to equality comparisons.
Thus, "0"==0 evaluates to false, and t[0] and t["0"] denote different entries
in a table.
The operator ~= is exactly the negation of equality (==).
The order operators work as follows. If both arguments are numbers, then they
are compared as such. Otherwise, if both arguments are strings, then their
values are compared according to the current locale. Otherwise, Lua tries to
call the "lt" or the "le" metamethod (see |lua51-sec2.8|). A comparison a > b
is translated to b < a and a >= b is translated to b <= a.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.5.3  Logical Operators                                      *lua51-sec2.5.3*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The logical operators in Lua are and, or, and not. Like the control structures
(see |lua51-sec2.4.4|), all logical operators consider both false and nil as
false and anything else as true.
The negation operator not always returns false or true. The conjunction
operator and returns its first argument if this value is false or nil;
otherwise, and returns its second argument. The disjunction operator or
returns its first argument if this value is different from nil and false;
otherwise, or returns its second argument. Both and and or use short-cut
evaluation; that is, the second operand is evaluated only if necessary. Here
are some examples:
>
     10 or 20            --> 10
     10 or error()       --> 10
     nil or "a"          --> "a"
     nil and 10          --> nil
     false and error()   --> false
     false and nil       --> false
     false or nil        --> nil
     10 and 20           --> 20
<
(In this manual, --> indicates the result of the preceding expression.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.5.4  Concatenation                                          *lua51-sec2.5.4*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The string concatenation operator in Lua is denoted by two dots ('..'). If
both operands are strings or numbers, then they are converted to strings
according to the rules mentioned in |lua51-sec2.2.1|. Otherwise, the "concat"
metamethod is called (see |lua51-sec2.8|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.5.5  The Length Operator                                    *lua51-sec2.5.5*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The length operator is denoted by the unary operator #. The length of a string
is its number of bytes (that is, the usual meaning of string length when each
character is one byte).
The length of a table t is defined to be any integer index n such that t[n] is
not nil and t[n+1] is nil; moreover, if t[1] is nil, n can be zero. For a
regular array, with non-nil values from 1 to a given n, its length is exactly
that n, the index of its last value. If the array has "holes" (that is, nil
values between other non-nil values), then #t can be any of the indices that
directly precedes a nil value (that is, it may consider any such nil value as
the end of the array).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.5.6  Precedence                                             *lua51-sec2.5.6*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operator precedence in Lua follows the table below, from lower to higher
priority:
>
     or
     and
     <     >     <=    >=    ~=    ==
     ..
     +     -
     *     /     %
     not   #     - (unary)
     ^
<
As usual, you can use parentheses to change the precedences of an expression.
The concatenation ('..') and exponentiation ('^') operators are right
associative. All other binary operators are left associative.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.5.7  Table Constructors                                     *lua51-sec2.5.7*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Table constructors are expressions that create tables. Every time a
constructor is evaluated, a new table is created. A constructor can be used to
create an empty table or to create a table and initialize some of its fields.
The general syntax for constructors is
>
	tableconstructor ::= `{´ [fieldlist] `}´
	fieldlist ::= field {fieldsep field} [fieldsep]
	field ::= `[´ exp `]´ `=´ exp | Name `=´ exp | exp
	fieldsep ::= `,´ | `;´
<
Each field of the form [exp1] = exp2 adds to the new table an entry with key
exp1 and value exp2. A field of the form name = exp is equivalent to ["name"]
= exp. Finally, fields of the form exp are equivalent to [i] = exp, where i
are consecutive numerical integers, starting with 1. Fields in the other
formats do not affect this counting. For example,
>
     a = { [f(1)] = g; "x", "y"; x = 1, f(x), [30] = 23; 45 }
<
is equivalent to
>
     do
       local t = {}
       t[f(1)] = g
       t[1] = "x"         -- 1st exp
       t[2] = "y"         -- 2nd exp
       t.x = 1            -- t["x"] = 1
       t[3] = f(x)        -- 3rd exp
       t[30] = 23
       t[4] = 45          -- 4th exp
       a = t
     end
<
If the last field in the list has the form exp and the expression is a
function call or a vararg expression, then all values returned by this
expression enter the list consecutively (see |lua51-sec2.5.8|). To avoid this,
enclose the function call or the vararg expression in parentheses (see
|lua51-sec2.5|).
The field list can have an optional trailing separator, as a convenience for
machine-generated code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.5.8  Function Calls                                         *lua51-sec2.5.8*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A function call in Lua has the following syntax:
>
	functioncall ::= prefixexp args
<
In a function call, first prefixexp and args are evaluated. If the value of
prefixexp has type function, then this function is called with the given
arguments. Otherwise, the prefixexp "call" metamethod is called, having as
first parameter the value of prefixexp, followed by the original call
arguments (see |lua51-sec2.8|).
The form
>
	functioncall ::= prefixexp `:´ Name args
<
can be used to call "methods". A call v:name(args) is syntactic sugar for
v.name(v,args), except that v is evaluated only once.
Arguments have the following syntax:
>
	args ::= `(´ [explist] `)´
	args ::= tableconstructor
	args ::= String
<
All argument expressions are evaluated before the call. A call of the form
f{fields} is syntactic sugar for f({fields}); that is, the argument list is a
single new table. A call of the form f'string' (or f"string" or f[[string]])
is syntactic sugar for f('string'); that is, the argument list is a single
literal string.
As an exception to the free-format syntax of Lua, you cannot put a line break
before the '(' in a function call. This restriction avoids some ambiguities in
the language. If you write
>
     a = f
     (g).x(a)
<
Lua would see that as a single statement, a = f(g).x(a). So, if you want two
statements, you must add a semi-colon between them. If you actually want to
call f, you must remove the line break before (g).
A call of the form return functioncall is called a tail call. Lua implements
proper tail calls (or proper tail recursion): in a tail call, the called
function reuses the stack entry of the calling function. Therefore, there is
no limit on the number of nested tail calls that a program can execute.
However, a tail call erases any debug information about the calling function.
Note that a tail call only happens with a particular syntax, where the return
has one single function call as argument; this syntax makes the calling
function return exactly the returns of the called function. So, none of the
following examples are tail calls:
>
     return (f(x))        -- results adjusted to 1
     return 2 * f(x)
     return x, f(x)       -- additional results
     f(x); return         -- results discarded
     return x or f(x)     -- results adjusted to 1
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.5.9  Function Definitions                                   *lua51-sec2.5.9*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The syntax for function definition is
>
	function ::= function funcbody
	funcbody ::= `(´ [parlist] `)´ block end
<
The following syntactic sugar simplifies function definitions:
>
	stat ::= function funcname funcbody
	stat ::= local function Name funcbody
	funcname ::= Name {`.´ Name} [`:´ Name]
<
The statement
>
     function f () body end
<
translates to
>
     f = function () body end
<
The statement
>
     function t.a.b.c.f () body end
<
translates to
>
     t.a.b.c.f = function () body end
<
The statement
>
     local function f () body end
<
translates to
>
     local f; f = function () body end
<
not to
>
     local f = function () body end
<
(This only makes a difference when the body of the function contains
references to f.)
A function definition is an executable expression, whose value has type
function. When Lua pre-compiles a chunk, all its function bodies are
pre-compiled too. Then, whenever Lua executes the function definition, the
function is instantiated (or closed). This function instance (or closure) is
the final value of the expression. Different instances of the same function
can refer to different external local variables and can have different
environment tables.
Parameters act as local variables that are initialized with the argument
values:
>
	parlist ::= namelist [`,´ `...´] | `...´
<
When a function is called, the list of arguments is adjusted to the length of
the list of parameters, unless the function is a variadic or vararg function,
which is indicated by three dots ('...') at the end of its parameter list. A
vararg function does not adjust its argument list; instead, it collects all
extra arguments and supplies them to the function through a vararg expression,
which is also written as three dots. The value of this expression is a list of
all actual extra arguments, similar to a function with multiple results. If a
vararg expression is used inside another expression or in the middle of a list
of expressions, then its return list is adjusted to one element. If the
expression is used as the last element of a list of expressions, then no
adjustment is made (unless that last expression is enclosed in parentheses).
As an example, consider the following definitions:
>
     function f(a, b) end
     function g(a, b, ...) end
     function r() return 1,2,3 end
<
Then, we have the following mapping from arguments to parameters and to the
vararg expression:
>
     CALL            PARAMETERS
     
     f(3)             a=3, b=nil
     f(3, 4)          a=3, b=4
     f(3, 4, 5)       a=3, b=4
     f(r(), 10)       a=1, b=10
     f(r())           a=1, b=2
     
     g(3)             a=3, b=nil, ... -->  (nothing)
     g(3, 4)          a=3, b=4,   ... -->  (nothing)
     g(3, 4, 5, 8)    a=3, b=4,   ... -->  5  8
     g(5, r())        a=5, b=1,   ... -->  2  3
<
Results are returned using the return statement (see |lua51-sec2.4.4|). If
control reaches the end of a function without encountering a return statement,
then the function returns with no results.
The colon syntax is used for defining methods, that is, functions that have an
implicit extra parameter self. Thus, the statement
>
     function t.a.b.c:f (params) body end
<
is syntactic sugar for
>
     t.a.b.c.f = function (self, params) body end
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.6  Visibility Rules                                           *lua51-sec2.6*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua is a lexically scoped language. The scope of variables begins at the first
statement after their declaration and lasts until the end of the innermost
block that includes the declaration. Consider the following example:
>
     x = 10                -- global variable
     do                    -- new block
       local x = x         -- new 'x', with value 10
       print(x)            --> 10
       x = x+1
       do                  -- another block
         local x = x+1     -- another 'x'
         print(x)          --> 12
       end
       print(x)            --> 11
     end
     print(x)              --> 10  (the global one)
<
Notice that, in a declaration like local x = x, the new x being declared is
not in scope yet, and so the second x refers to the outside variable.
Because of the lexical scoping rules, local variables can be freely accessed
by functions defined inside their scope. A local variable used by an inner
function is called an upvalue, or external local variable, inside the inner
function.
Notice that each execution of a local statement defines new local variables.
Consider the following example:
>
     a = {}
     local x = 20
     for i=1,10 do
       local y = 0
       a[i] = function () y=y+1; return x+y end
     end
<
The loop creates ten closures (that is, ten instances of the anonymous
function). Each of these closures uses a different y variable, while all of
them share the same x.

2.7  Error Handling                                             *lua51-sec2.7*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because Lua is an embedded extension language, all Lua actions start from C
code in the host program calling a function from the Lua library (see
|lua51-lua_pcall|). Whenever an error occurs during Lua compilation or
execution, control returns to C, which can take appropriate measures (such as
printing an error message).
Lua code can explicitly generate an error by calling the |lua51-error|
function. If you need to catch errors in Lua, you can use the |lua51-pcall|
function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.8  Metatables                                                 *lua51-sec2.8*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every value in Lua can have a metatable. This metatable is an ordinary Lua
table that defines the behavior of the original value under certain special
operations. You can change several aspects of the behavior of operations over
a value by setting specific fields in its metatable. For instance, when a
non-numeric value is the operand of an addition, Lua checks for a function in
the field "__add" in its metatable. If it finds one, Lua calls this function
to perform the addition.
We call the keys in a metatable events and the values metamethods. In the
previous example, the event is "add" and the metamethod is the function that
performs the addition.
You can query the metatable of any value through the |lua51-getmetatable|
function.
You can replace the metatable of tables through the |lua51-setmetatable|
function. You cannot change the metatable of other types from Lua (except by
using the debug library); you must use the C API for that.
Tables and full userdata have individual metatables (although multiple tables
and userdata can share their metatables). Values of all other types share one
single metatable per type; that is, there is one single metatable for all
numbers, one for all strings, etc.
A metatable controls how an object behaves in arithmetic operations, order
comparisons, concatenation, length operation, and indexing. A metatable also
can define a function to be called when a userdata is garbage collected. For
each of these operations Lua associates a specific key called an event. When
Lua performs one of these operations over a value, it checks whether this
value has a metatable with the corresponding event. If so, the value
associated with that key (the metamethod) controls how Lua will perform the
operation.
Metatables control the operations listed next. Each operation is identified by
its corresponding name. The key for each operation is a string with its name
prefixed by two underscores, '__'; for instance, the key for operation "add"
is the string "__add". The semantics of these operations is better explained
by a Lua function describing how the interpreter executes the operation.
The code shown here in Lua is only illustrative; the real behavior is hard
coded in the interpreter and it is much more efficient than this simulation.
All functions used in these descriptions (|lua51-rawget|, |lua51-tonumber|,
etc.) are described in |lua51-sec5.1|. In particular, to retrieve the
metamethod of a given object, we use the expression
>
     metatable(obj)[event]
<
This should be read as
>
     rawget(getmetatable(obj) or {}, event)
<
That is, the access to a metamethod does not invoke other metamethods, and the
access to objects with no metatables does not fail (it simply results in nil).
- "add": the + operation.
  The function getbinhandler below defines how Lua chooses a handler for a
  binary operation. First, Lua tries the first operand. If its type does not
  define a handler for the operation, then Lua tries the second operand.
>
       function getbinhandler (op1, op2, event)
         return metatable(op1)[event] or metatable(op2)[event]
       end
<
  By using this function, the behavior of the op1 + op2 is
>
       function add_event (op1, op2)
         local o1, o2 = tonumber(op1), tonumber(op2)
         if o1 and o2 then  -- both operands are numeric?
           return o1 + o2   -- '+' here is the primitive 'add'
         else  -- at least one of the operands is not numeric
           local h = getbinhandler(op1, op2, "__add")
           if h then
             -- call the handler with both operands
             return (h(op1, op2))
           else  -- no handler available: default behavior
             error(...)
           end
         end
       end
<
- "sub": the - operation. Behavior similar to the "add" operation.
- "mul": the * operation. Behavior similar to the "add" operation.
- "div": the / operation. Behavior similar to the "add" operation.
- "mod": the % operation. Behavior similar to the "add" operation, with the
  operation o1 - floor(o1/o2)*o2 as the primitive operation.
- "pow": the ^ (exponentiation) operation. Behavior similar to the "add"
  operation, with the function pow (from the C math library) as the primitive
  operation.
- "unm": the unary - operation.
>
       function unm_event (op)
         local o = tonumber(op)
         if o then  -- operand is numeric?
           return -o  -- '-' here is the primitive 'unm'
         else  -- the operand is not numeric.
           -- Try to get a handler from the operand
           local h = metatable(op).__unm
           if h then
             -- call the handler with the operand
             return (h(op))
           else  -- no handler available: default behavior
             error(...)
           end
         end
       end
<
- "concat": the .. (concatenation) operation.
>
       function concat_event (op1, op2)
         if (type(op1) == "string" or type(op1) == "number") and
            (type(op2) == "string" or type(op2) == "number") then
           return op1 .. op2  -- primitive string concatenation
         else
           local h = getbinhandler(op1, op2, "__concat")
           if h then
             return (h(op1, op2))
           else
             error(...)
           end
         end
       end
<
- "len": the # operation.

       function len_event (op)
         if type(op) == "string" then
           return strlen(op)         -- primitive string length
         elseif type(op) == "table" then
           return #op                -- primitive table length
         else
           local h = metatable(op).__len
           if h then
             -- call the handler with the operand
             return (h(op))
           else  -- no handler available: default behavior
             error(...)

         end
       end
<
  See |lua51-sec2.5.5| for a description of the length of a table.
- "eq": the == operation. The function getcomphandler defines how Lua chooses
  a metamethod for comparison operators. A metamethod only is selected when
  both objects being compared have the same type and the same metamethod for
  the selected operation.
>
       function getcomphandler (op1, op2, event)
         if type(op1) ~= type(op2) then return nil end

         local mm2 = metatable(op2)[event]
         if mm1 == mm2 then return mm1 else return nil end
       end
<
  The "eq" event is defined as follows:
>
       function eq_event (op1, op2)
         if type(op1) ~= type(op2) then  -- different types?
           return false   -- different objects
         end
         if op1 == op2 then   -- primitive equal?
           return true   -- objects are equal
         end
         -- try metamethod
         local h = getcomphandler(op1, op2, "__eq")
         if h then
           return (h(op1, op2))
         else
           return false
         end
       end
<
  a ~= b is equivalent to not (a == b).
- "lt": the < operation.
>
       function lt_event (op1, op2)
         if type(op1) == "number" and type(op2) == "number" then
           return op1 < op2   -- numeric comparison
         elseif type(op1) == "string" and type(op2) == "string" then
           return op1 < op2   -- lexicographic comparison
         else
           local h = getcomphandler(op1, op2, "__lt")
           if h then
             return (h(op1, op2))
           else
             error(...)
           end
         end
       end
<
  a > b is equivalent to b < a.
- "le": the <= operation.
>
       function le_event (op1, op2)
         if type(op1) == "number" and type(op2) == "number" then
           return op1 <= op2   -- numeric comparison
         elseif type(op1) == "string" and type(op2) == "string" then

             else
               error(...)
             end
           end
         end
       end
<
  a >= b is equivalent to b <= a. Note that, in the absence of a "le"
  metamethod, Lua tries the "lt", assuming that a <= b is equivalent to not (b
< a).
- "index": The indexing access table[key].
>
       function gettable_event (table, key)
         local h
         if type(table) == "table" then

2.9  Environments                                               *lua51-sec2.9*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Besides metatables, objects of types thread, function, and userdata have
another table associated with them, called their environment. Like metatables,
environments are regular tables and multiple objects can share the same
environment.
Threads are created sharing the environment of the creating thread. Userdata
and C functions are created sharing the environment of the creating C
function. Non-nested Lua functions (created by |lua51-loadfile|,
|lua51-loadstring| or |lua51-load|) are created sharing the environment of the
creating thread. Nested Lua functions are created sharing the environment of
the creating Lua function.
Environments associated with userdata have no meaning for Lua. It is only a
convenience feature for programmers to associate a table to a userdata.
Environments associated with threads are called global environments. They are
used as the default environment for threads and non-nested Lua functions
created by the thread and can be directly accessed by C code (see
|lua51-sec3.3|).
The environment associated with a C function can be directly accessed by C
code (see |lua51-sec3.3|). It is used as the default environment for other C
functions and userdata created by the function.
Environments associated with Lua functions are used to resolve all accesses to
global variables within the function (see |lua51-sec2.3|). They are used as
the default environment for nested Lua functions created by the function.
You can change the environment of a Lua function or the running thread by
calling |lua51-setfenv|. You can get the environment of a Lua function or the
running thread by calling |lua51-getfenv|. To manipulate the environment of
other objects (userdata, C functions, other threads) you must use the C API.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.10  Garbage Collection                                       *lua51-sec2.10*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua performs automatic memory management. This means that you have to worry
neither about allocating memory for new objects nor about freeing it when the
objects are no longer needed. Lua manages memory automatically by running a
garbage collector from time to time to collect all dead objects (that is,
objects that are no longer accessible from Lua). All memory used by Lua is
subject to automatic management: tables, userdata, functions, threads,
strings, etc.
Lua implements an incremental mark-and-sweep collector. It uses two numbers to
control its garbage-collection cycles: the garbage-collector pause and the
garbage-collector step multiplier. Both use percentage points as units (so
that a value of 100 means an internal value of 1).
The garbage-collector pause controls how long the collector waits before
starting a new cycle. Larger values make the collector less aggressive. Values
smaller than 100 mean the collector will not wait to start a new cycle. A
value of 200 means that the collector waits for the total memory in use to
double before starting a new cycle.
The step multiplier controls the relative speed of the collector relative to
memory allocation. Larger values make the collector more aggressive but also
increase the size of each incremental step. Values smaller than 100 make the
collector too slow and can result in the collector never finishing a cycle.
The default, 200, means that the collector runs at "twice" the speed of memory
allocation.
You can change these numbers by calling |lua51-lua_gc| in C or
|lua51-collectgarbage| in Lua. With these functions you can also control the
collector directly (e.g., stop and restart it).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.10.1  Garbage                                              *lua51-sec2.10.1*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the C API, you can set garbage-collector metamethods for userdata (see
|lua51-sec2.8|). These metamethods are also called finalizers. Finalizers
allow you to coordinate Lua's garbage collection with external resource
management (such as closing files, network or database connections, or freeing
your own memory).
Garbage userdata with a field __gc in their metatables are not collected
immediately by the garbage collector. Instead, Lua puts them in a list. After
the collection, Lua does the equivalent of the following function for each
userdata in that list:
>
     function gc_event (udata)
       local h = metatable(udata).__gc
       if h then
         h(udata)
       end
     end
<
At the end of each garbage-collection cycle, the finalizers for userdata are
called in reverse order of their creation, among those collected in that
cycle. That is, the first finalizer to be called is the one associated with
the userdata created last in the program. The userdata itself is freed only in
the next garbage-collection cycle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.10.2  Weak Tables                                          *lua51-sec2.10.2*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A weak table is a table whose elements are weak references. A weak reference
is ignored by the garbage collector. In other words, if the only references to
an object are weak references, then the garbage collector will collect this
object.
A weak table can have weak keys, weak values, or both. A table with weak keys
allows the collection of its keys, but prevents the collection of its values.
A table with both weak keys and weak values allows the collection of both keys
and values. In any case, if either the key or the value is collected, the
whole pair is removed from the table. The weakness of a table is controlled by
the __mode field of its metatable. If the __mode field is a string containing
the character 'k', the keys in the table are weak. If __mode contains 'v', the
values in the table are weak.
After you use a table as a metatable, you should not change the value of its
__mode field. Otherwise, the weak behavior of the tables controlled by this
metatable is undefined.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.11  Coroutines                                               *lua51-sec2.11*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua supports coroutines, also called collaborative multithreading. A coroutine
in Lua represents an independent thread of execution. Unlike threads in
multithread systems, however, a coroutine only suspends its execution by
explicitly calling a yield function.
You create a coroutine with a call to |lua51-coroutine.create|. Its sole
argument is a function that is the main function of the coroutine. The create
function only creates a new coroutine and returns a handle to it (an object of
type thread); it does not start the coroutine execution.
When you first call |lua51-coroutine.resume|, passing as its first argument a
thread returned by |lua51-coroutine.create|, the coroutine starts its
execution, at the first line of its main function. Extra arguments passed to
|lua51-coroutine.resume| are passed on to the coroutine main function. After
the coroutine starts running, it runs until it terminates or yields.
A coroutine can terminate its execution in two ways: normally, when its main
function returns (explicitly or implicitly, after the last instruction); and
abnormally, if there is an unprotected error. In the first case,
|lua51-coroutine.resume| returns true, plus any values returned by the
coroutine main function. In case of errors, |lua51-coroutine.resume| returns
false plus an error message.
A coroutine yields by calling |lua51-coroutine.yield|. When a coroutine
yields, the corresponding |lua51-coroutine.resume| returns immediately, even
if the yield happens inside nested function calls (that is, not in the main
function, but in a function directly or indirectly called by the main
function). In the case of a yield, |lua51-coroutine.resume| also returns true,
plus any values passed to |lua51-coroutine.yield|. The next time you resume
the same coroutine, it continues its execution from the point where it
yielded, with the call to |lua51-coroutine.yield| returning any extra
arguments passed to |lua51-coroutine.resume|.
Like |lua51-coroutine.create|, the |lua51-coroutine.wrap| function also
creates a coroutine, but instead of returning the coroutine itself, it returns
a function that, when called, resumes the coroutine. Any arguments passed to
this function go as extra arguments to |lua51-coroutine.resume|.
|lua51-coroutine.wrap| returns all the values returned by
|lua51-coroutine.resume|, except the first one (the boolean error code).
Unlike |lua51-coroutine.resume|, |lua51-coroutine.wrap| does not catch errors;
any error is propagated to the caller.
As an example, consider the following code:
>
     function foo (a)
       print("foo", a)
       return coroutine.yield(2*a)
     end
     
     co = coroutine.create(function (a,b)
           print("co-body", a, b)
           local r = foo(a+1)
           print("co-body", r)
           local r, s = coroutine.yield(a+b, a-b)
           print("co-body", r, s)
           return b, "end"
     end)
            
     print("main", coroutine.resume(co, 1, 10))
     print("main", coroutine.resume(co, "r"))
     print("main", coroutine.resume(co, "x", "y"))
     print("main", coroutine.resume(co, "x", "y"))
<
When you run it, it produces the following output:
>
     co-body 1       10
     foo     2
     
     main    true    4
     co-body r
     main    true    11      -9
     co-body x       y
     main    true    10      end
     main    false   cannot resume dead coroutine

3.  The Application Program Interface                             *lua51-sec3*
==============================================================================

This section describes the C API for Lua, that is, the set of C functions
available to the host program to communicate with Lua. All API functions and
related types and constants are declared in the header file lua.h.
Even when we use the term "function", any facility in the API may be provided
as a macro instead. All such macros use each of their arguments exactly once
(except for the first argument, which is always a Lua state), and so do not
generate any hidden side-effects.
As in most C libraries, the Lua API functions do not check their arguments for
validity or consistency. However, you can change this behavior by compiling
Lua with a proper definition for the macro luai_apicheck, in file luaconf.h.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1  The Stack                                                  *lua51-sec3.1*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua uses a virtual stack to pass values to and from C. Each element in this
stack represents a Lua value (nil, number, string, etc.).
Whenever Lua calls C, the called function gets a new stack, which is
independent of previous stacks and of stacks of C functions that are still
active. This stack initially contains any arguments to the C function and it
is where the C function pushes its results to be returned to the caller (see
|lua51-lua_CFunction|).
For convenience, most query operations in the API do not follow a strict stack
discipline. Instead, they can refer to any element in the stack by using an
index: A positive index represents an absolute stack position (starting at 1);
a negative index represents an offset relative to the top of the stack. More
specifically, if the stack has n elements, then index 1 represents the first
element (that is, the element that was pushed onto the stack first) and index
n represents the last element; index -1 also represents the last element (that
is, the element at the top) and index -n represents the first element. We say
that an index is valid if it lies between 1 and the stack top (that is, if 1
<= abs(index) <= top).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2  Stack Size                                                 *lua51-sec3.2*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                          *lua51-LUA_MINSTACK*

When you interact with Lua API, you are responsible for ensuring consistency.
In particular, you are responsible for controlling stack overflow. You can use
the function |lua51-lua_checkstack| to grow the stack size.
Whenever Lua calls C, it ensures that at least LUA_MINSTACK stack positions
are available. LUA_MINSTACK is defined as 20, so that usually you do not have
to worry about stack space unless your code has loops pushing elements onto
the stack.
Most query functions accept as indices any value inside the available stack
space, that is, indices up to the maximum stack size you have set through
|lua51-lua_checkstack|. Such indices are called acceptable indices. More
formally, we define an acceptable index as follows:
>
     (index < 0 && abs(index) <= top) ||
     (index > 0 && index <= stackspace)
<
Note that 0 is never an acceptable index.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3  Pseudo                                                     *lua51-sec3.3*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                      *lua51-LUA_GLOBALSINDEX*
                                                      *lua51-LUA_ENVIRONINDEX*

Unless otherwise noted, any function that accepts valid indices can also be
called with pseudo-indices, which represent some Lua values that are
accessible to C code but which are not in the stack. Pseudo-indices are used
to access the thread environment, the function environment, the registry, and
the upvalues of a C function (see |lua51-sec3.4|).
The thread environment (where global variables live) is always at pseudo-index
LUA_GLOBALSINDEX. The environment of the running C function is always at
pseudo-index LUA_ENVIRONINDEX.
To access and change the value of global variables, you can use regular table
operations over an environment table. For instance, to access the value of a
global variable, do
>
     lua_getfield(L, LUA_GLOBALSINDEX, varname);
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4  C Closures                                                 *lua51-sec3.4*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                      *lua51-lua_upvalueindex*

When a C function is created, it is possible to associate some values with it,
thus creating a C closure; these values are called upvalues and are accessible
to the function whenever it is called (see |lua51-lua_pushcclosure|).
Whenever a C function is called, its upvalues are located at specific
pseudo-indices. These pseudo-indices are produced by the macro
lua_upvalueindex. The first value associated with a function is at position
lua_upvalueindex(1), and so on. Any access to lua_upvalueindex(n), where n is
greater than the number of upvalues of the current function (but not greater
than 256), produces an acceptable (but invalid) index.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.5  Registry                                                   *lua51-sec3.5*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                     *lua51-LUA_REGISTRYINDEX*

Lua provides a registry, a pre-defined table that can be used by any C code to
store whatever Lua value it needs to store. This table is always located at
pseudo-index LUA_REGISTRYINDEX. Any C library can store data into this table,
but it should take care to choose keys different from those used by other
libraries, to avoid collisions. Typically, you should use as key a string
containing your library name or a light userdata with the address of a C
object in your code.
The integer keys in the registry are used by the reference mechanism,
implemented by the auxiliary library, and therefore should not be used for
other purposes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.6  Error Handling in C                                        *lua51-sec3.6*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Internally, Lua uses the C longjmp facility to handle errors. (You can also
choose to use exceptions if you use C++; see file luaconf.h.) When Lua faces
any error (such as memory allocation errors, type errors, syntax errors, and
runtime errors) it raises an error; that is, it does a long jump. A protected
environment uses setjmp to set a recover point; any error jumps to the most
recent active recover point.
Most functions in the API can throw an error, for instance due to a memory
allocation error. The documentation for each function indicates whether it can
throw errors.
Inside a C function you can throw an error by calling |lua51-lua_error|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.7  Functions and Types                                        *lua51-sec3.7*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here we list all functions and types from the C API in alphabetical order.
Each function has an indicator like this:
                                                                   [-o, +p, x]
The first field, o, is how many elements the function pops from the stack. The
second field, p, is how many elements the function pushes onto the stack. (Any
function always pushes its results after popping its arguments.) A field in
the form x|y means the function can push (or pop) x or y elements, depending
on the situation; an interrogation mark '?' means that we cannot know how many
elements the function pops/pushes by looking only at its arguments (e.g., they
may depend on what is on the stack). The third field, x, tells whether the
function may throw errors: '-' means the function never throws any error; 'm'
means the function may throw an error only due to not enough memory; 'e' means
the function may throw other kinds of errors; 'v' means the function may throw
an error on purpose.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua51-lua_Alloc*
lua_Alloc ~
>
    typedef void * (*lua_Alloc) (void *ud,
                                 void *ptr,
                                 size_t osize,
                                 size_t nsize);
<
The type of the memory-allocation function used by Lua states. The allocator
function must provide a functionality similar to realloc, but not exactly the
same. Its arguments are ud, an opaque pointer passed to |lua51-lua_newstate|;
ptr, a pointer to the block being allocated/reallocated/freed; osize, the
original size of the block; nsize, the new size of the block. ptr is NULL if
and only if osize is zero. When nsize is zero, the allocator must return NULL;
if osize is not zero, it should free the block pointed to by ptr. When nsize
is not zero, the allocator returns NULL if and only if it cannot fill the
request. When nsize is not zero and osize is zero, the allocator should behave
like malloc. When nsize and osize are not zero, the allocator behaves like
realloc. Lua assumes that the allocator never fails when osize >= nsize.
Here is a simple implementation for the allocator function. It is used in the
auxiliary library by |lua51-luaL_newstate|.
>
     static void *l_alloc (void *ud, void *ptr, size_t osize,
                                                size_t nsize) {
       (void)ud;  (void)osize;  /* not used */
       if (nsize == 0) {
         free(ptr);
         return NULL;
       }
       else
         return realloc(ptr, nsize);
     }
<
This code assumes that free(NULL) has no effect and that realloc(NULL, size)
is equivalent to malloc(size). ANSI C ensures both behaviors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *lua51-lua_atpanic*
lua_atpanic ~
                                                                   [-0, +0, -]
>
    lua_CFunction lua_atpanic (lua_State *L, lua_CFunction panicf);
<
Sets a new panic function and returns the old one.
If an error happens outside any protected environment, Lua calls a panic
function and then calls exit(EXIT_FAILURE), thus exiting the host application.
Your panic function can avoid this exit by never returning (e.g., doing a long
jump).
The panic function can access the error message at the top of the stack.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *lua51-LUA_MULTRET*
                                                              *lua51-lua_call*
lua_call ~
                                                [-( nargs + 1 ), +nresults, e]
>
    void lua_call (lua_State *L, int nargs, int nresults);
<
Calls a function.
To call a function you must use the following protocol: first, the function to
be called is pushed onto the stack; then, the arguments to the function are
pushed in direct order; that is, the first argument is pushed first. Finally
you call |lua51-lua_call|; nargs is the number of arguments that you pushed
onto the stack. All arguments and the function value are popped from the stack
when the function is called. The function results are pushed onto the stack
when the function returns. The number of results is adjusted to nresults,
unless nresults is LUA_MULTRET. In this case, all results from the function
are pushed. Lua takes care that the returned values fit into the stack space.
The function results are pushed onto the stack in direct order (the first
result is pushed first), so that after the call the last result is on the top
of the stack.
Any error inside the called function is propagated upwards (with a longjmp).
The following example shows how the host program can do the equivalent to this
Lua code:
>
     a = f("how", t.x, 14)
<
Here it is in C:
>
     lua_getfield(L, LUA_GLOBALSINDEX, "f"); /* function to be called */
     lua_pushstring(L, "how");                        /* 1st argument */
     lua_getfield(L, LUA_GLOBALSINDEX, "t");   /* table to be indexed */
     lua_getfield(L, -1, "x");        /* push result of t.x (2nd arg) */
     lua_remove(L, -2);                  /* remove 't' from the stack */
     lua_pushinteger(L, 14);                          /* 3rd argument */
     lua_call(L, 3, 1);     /* call 'f' with 3 arguments and 1 result */
     lua_setfield(L, LUA_GLOBALSINDEX, "a");        /* set global 'a' */
<
Note that the code above is "balanced": at its end, the stack is back to its
original configuration. This is considered good programming practice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                         *lua51-lua_CFunction*
lua_CFunction ~
>
    typedef int (*lua_CFunction) (lua_State *L);
<
Type for C functions.
In order to communicate properly with Lua, a C function must use the following
protocol, which defines the way parameters and results are passed: a C
function receives its arguments from Lua in its stack in direct order (the
first argument is pushed first). So, when the function starts, lua_gettop(L)
returns the number of arguments received by the function. The first argument
(if any) is at index 1 and its last argument is at index lua_gettop(L). To
return values to Lua, a C function just pushes them onto the stack, in direct
order (the first result is pushed first), and returns the number of results.
Any other value in the stack below the results will be properly discarded by
Lua. Like a Lua function, a C function called by Lua can also return many
results.
As an example, the following function receives a variable number of numerical
arguments and returns their average and sum:
>
     static int foo (lua_State *L) {
       int n = lua_gettop(L);    /* number of arguments */
       lua_Number sum = 0;
       int i;
       for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
         if (!lua_isnumber(L, i)) {
           lua_pushstring(L, "incorrect argument");
           lua_error(L);
         }
         sum += lua_tonumber(L, i);
       }
       lua_pushnumber(L, sum/n);        /* first result */
       lua_pushnumber(L, sum);         /* second result */
       return 2;                   /* number of results */
     }
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                        *lua51-lua_checkstack*
lua_checkstack ~
                                                                   [-0, +0, m]
>
    int lua_checkstack (lua_State *L, int extra);
<
Ensures that there are at least extra free stack slots in the stack. It
returns false if it cannot grow the stack to that size. This function never
shrinks the stack; if the stack is already larger than the new size, it is
left unchanged.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua51-lua_close*
lua_close ~
                                                                   [-0, +0, -]
>
    void lua_close (lua_State *L);
<
Destroys all objects in the given Lua state (calling the corresponding
garbage-collection metamethods, if any) and frees all dynamic memory used by
this state. On several platforms, you may not need to call this function,
because all resources are naturally released when the host program ends. On
the other hand, long-running programs, such as a daemon or a web server, might
need to release states as soon as they are not needed, to avoid growing too
large.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua51-lua_concat*
lua_concat ~
                                                                   [-n, +1, e]
>
    void lua_concat (lua_State *L, int n);
<
Concatenates the n values at the top of the stack, pops them, and leaves the
result at the top. If n is 1, the result is the single value on the stack
(that is, the function does nothing); if n is 0, the result is the empty
string. Concatenation is performed following the usual semantics of Lua (see
|lua51-sec2.5.4|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua51-lua_cpcall*
lua_cpcall ~

>
    int lua_cpcall (lua_State *L, lua_CFunction func, void *ud);
<
Calls the C function func in protected mode. func starts with only one element
in its stack, a light userdata containing ud. In case of errors,
|lua51-lua_cpcall| returns the same error codes as |lua51-lua_pcall|, plus the
error object on the top of the stack; otherwise, it returns zero, and does not
change the stack. All values returned by func are discarded.

    void lua_createtable (lua_State *L, int narr, int nrec);
<
Creates a new empty table and pushes it onto the stack. The new table has
space pre-allocated for narr array elements and nrec non-array elements. This
pre-allocation is useful when you know exactly how many elements the table
will have. Otherwise you can use the function |lua51-lua_newtable|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    int lua_dump (lua_State *L, lua_Writer writer, void *data);
<
Dumps a function as a binary chunk. Receives a Lua function on the top of the
stack and produces a binary chunk that, if loaded again, results in a function
equivalent to the one dumped. As it produces parts of the chunk,
|lua51-lua_dump| calls function writer (see |lua51-lua_Writer|) with the given
data to write them.
The value returned is the error code returned by the last call to the writer;
0 means no errors.
This function does not pop the Lua function from the stack.

Returns 1 if the two values in acceptable indices index1 and index2 are equal,

metamethods). Otherwise returns 0. Also returns 0 if any of the indices is non
valid.

Generates a Lua error. The error message (which can actually be a Lua value of
any type) must be on the stack top. This function does a long jump, and
therefore never returns. (see |lua51-luaL_error|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    int lua_gc (lua_State *L, int what, int data);
<
Controls the garbage collector.
This function performs several tasks, according to the value of the parameter
what:
- LUA_GCSTOP: stops the garbage collector.
- LUA_GCRESTART: restarts the garbage collector.
- LUA_GCCOLLECT: performs a full garbage-collection cycle.
- LUA_GCCOUNT: returns the current amount of memory (in Kbytes) in use by Lua.
- LUA_GCCOUNTB: returns the remainder of dividing the current amount of bytes
  of memory in use by Lua by 1024.
- LUA_GCSTEP: performs an incremental step of garbage collection. The step
  "size" is controlled by data (larger values mean more steps) in a
  non-specified way. If you want to control the step size you must
  experimentally tune the value of data. The function returns 1 if the step
  finished a garbage-collection cycle.
- LUA_GCSETPAUSE: sets data as the new value for the pause of the collector
  (see |lua51-sec2.10|). The function returns the previous value of the pause.
- LUA_GCSETSTEPMUL: sets data as the new value for the step multiplier of the
  collector (see |lua51-sec2.10|). The function returns the previous value of
  the step multiplier.

                  const char *chunkname);
<
Loads a Lua chunk. If there are no errors, |lua51-lua_load| pushes the
compiled chunk as a Lua function on top of the stack. Otherwise, it pushes an
error message. The return values of |lua51-lua_load| are:
- 0: no errors;
- LUA_ERRSYNTAX: syntax error during pre-compilation;
- LUA_ERRMEM (|lua51-LUA_ERRMEM|): memory allocation error.
This function only loads a chunk; it does not run it.
|lua51-lua_load| automatically detects whether the chunk is text or binary,
and loads it accordingly (see program luac).
The |lua51-lua_load| function uses a user-supplied reader function to read the
chunk (see |lua51-lua_Reader|). The data argument is an opaque value passed to
the reader function.
The chunkname argument gives a name to the chunk, which is used for error
messages and in debug information (see |lua51-sec3.8|).

    lua_State *lua_newstate (lua_Alloc f, void *ud);
<
Creates a new, independent state. Returns NULL if cannot create the state (due
to lack of memory). The argument f is the allocator function; Lua does all
memory allocation for this state through this function. The second argument,
ud, is an opaque pointer that Lua simply passes to the allocator in every
call.

lua_createtable(L, 0, 0).

>
    lua_State *lua_newthread (lua_State *L);
<
Creates a new thread, pushes it on the stack, and returns a pointer to a
|lua51-lua_State| that represents this new thread. The new state returned by
this function shares with the original state all global objects (such as
tables), but has an independent execution stack.
There is no explicit function to close or to destroy a thread. Threads are
subject to garbage collection, like any Lua object.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                       *lua51-lua_newuserdata*

>
    void *lua_newuserdata (lua_State *L, size_t size);
<
This function allocates a new block of memory with the given size, pushes onto
the stack a new full userdata with the block address, and returns this
address.
Userdata represent C values in Lua. A full userdata represents a block of
memory. It is an object (like a table): you must create it, it can have its
own metatable, and you can detect when it is being collected. A full userdata
is only equal to itself (under raw equality).
When Lua collects a full userdata with a gc metamethod, Lua calls the
metamethod and marks the userdata as finalized. When this userdata is
collected again then Lua frees its corresponding memory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua51-lua_next*

>
    int lua_next (lua_State *L, int index);
<
Pops a key from the stack, and pushes a key-value pair from the table at the
given index (the "next" pair after the given key). If there are no more
elements in the table, then |lua51-lua_next| returns 0 (and pushes nothing).
A typical traversal looks like this:
>
     /* table is in the stack at index 't' */
     lua_pushnil(L);  /* first key */
     while (lua_next(L, t) != 0) {
       /* uses 'key' (at index -2) and 'value' (at index -1) */
       printf("%s - %s\n",
              lua_typename(L, lua_type(L, -2)),
              lua_typename(L, lua_type(L, -1)));
       /* removes 'value'; keeps 'key' for next iteration */
       lua_pop(L, 1);
     }
<
While traversing a table, do not call |lua51-lua_tolstring| directly on a key,
unless you know that the key is actually a string. Recall that
|lua51-lua_tolstring| changes the value at the given index; this confuses the
next call to |lua51-lua_next|.

    size_t lua_objlen (lua_State *L, int index);

Returns the "length" of the value at the given acceptable index: for strings,
this is the string length; for tables, this is the result of the length
operator ('#'); for userdata, this is the size of the block of memory
allocated for the userdata; for other values, it is 0.

>
    int lua_pcall (lua_State *L, int nargs, int nresults, int errfunc);
<
Calls a function in protected mode.
Both nargs and nresults have the same meaning as in |lua51-lua_call|. If there
are no errors during the call, |lua51-lua_pcall| behaves exactly like
|lua51-lua_call|. However, if there is any error, |lua51-lua_pcall| catches
it, pushes a single value on the stack (the error message), and returns an
error code. Like |lua51-lua_call|, |lua51-lua_pcall| always removes the
function and its arguments from the stack.
If errfunc is 0, then the error message returned on the stack is exactly the
original error message. Otherwise, errfunc is the stack index of an error
handler function. (In the current implementation, this index cannot be a
pseudo-index.) In case of runtime errors, this function will be called with
the error message and its return value will be the message returned on the
stack by |lua51-lua_pcall|.
Typically, the error handler function is used to add more debug information to
the error message, such as a stack traceback. Such information cannot be
gathered after the return of |lua51-lua_pcall|, since by then the stack has
unwound.
The |lua51-lua_pcall| function returns 0 in case of success or one of the
following error codes (defined in lua.h):
- LUA_ERRRUN: a runtime error.
- LUA_ERRMEM: memory allocation error. For such errors, Lua does not call the
  error handler function.
- LUA_ERRERR: error while running the error handler function.

>
    void lua_pushcclosure (lua_State *L, lua_CFunction fn, int n);
<
Pushes a new C closure onto the stack.
When a C function is created, it is possible to associate some values with it,
thus creating a C closure (see |lua51-sec3.4|); these values are then
accessible to the function whenever it is called. To associate values with a C
function, first these values should be pushed onto the stack (when there are
multiple values, the first value is pushed first). Then
|lua51-lua_pushcclosure| is called to create and push the C function onto the
stack, with the argument n telling how many values should be associated with
the function. |lua51-lua_pushcclosure| also pops these values from the stack.
The maximum value for n is 255.

>
    void lua_pushcfunction (lua_State *L, lua_CFunction f);
<
Pushes a C function onto the stack. This function receives a pointer to a C
function and pushes onto the stack a Lua value of type function that, when
called, invokes the corresponding C function.
Any function to be registered in Lua must follow the correct protocol to
receive its parameters and return its results (see |lua51-lua_CFunction|).
lua_pushcfunction is defined as a macro:

     #define lua_pushcfunction(L,f)  lua_pushcclosure(L,f,0)

>
    const char *lua_pushfstring (lua_State *L, const char *fmt, ...);
<
Pushes onto the stack a formatted string and returns a pointer to this string.
It is similar to the C function sprintf, but has some important differences:
- You do not have to allocate space for the result: the result is a Lua string
  and Lua takes care of memory allocation (and deallocation, through garbage
  collection).
- The conversion specifiers are quite restricted. There are no flags, widths,
  or precisions. The conversion specifiers can only be '%%' (inserts a '%' in
  the string), '%s' (inserts a zero-terminated string, with no size
  restrictions), '%f' (inserts a |lua51-lua_Number|), '%p' (inserts a pointer
  as a hexadecimal numeral), '%d' (inserts an int), and '%c' (inserts an int
  as a character).

>
    void lua_pushlightuserdata (lua_State *L, void *p);
<
Pushes a light userdata onto the stack.
Userdata represent C values in Lua. A light userdata represents a pointer. It
is a value (like a number): you do not create it, it has no individual
metatable, and it is not collected (as it was never created). A light userdata
is equal to "any" light userdata with the same C address.

    int lua_resume (lua_State *L, int narg);
<
Starts and resumes a coroutine in a given thread.
To start a coroutine, you first create a new thread (see
|lua51-lua_newthread|); then you push onto its stack the main function plus
any arguments; then you call |lua51-lua_resume|, with narg being the number of
arguments. This call returns when the coroutine suspends or finishes its
execution. When it returns, the stack contains all values passed to
|lua51-lua_yield|, or all values returned by the body function.
|lua51-lua_resume| returns LUA_YIELD (|lua51-LUA_YIELD|) if the coroutine
yields, 0 if the coroutine finishes its execution without errors, or an error
code in case of errors (see |lua51-lua_pcall|). In case of errors, the stack
is not unwound, so you can use the debug API over it. The error message is on
the top of the stack. To restart a coroutine, you put on its stack only the
values to be passed as results from yield, and then call |lua51-lua_resume|.

library is fully reentrant: it has no global variables. All information about
a state is kept in this structure.
A pointer to this state must be passed as the first argument to every function
in the library, except to |lua51-lua_newstate|, which creates a Lua state from
scratch.

    int lua_status (lua_State *L);

The status can be 0 for a normal thread, an error code if the thread finished
its execution with an error, or LUA_YIELD if the thread is suspended.

>
    int lua_toboolean (lua_State *L, int index);
<
Converts the Lua value at the given acceptable index to a C boolean value (0
or 1). Like all tests in Lua, |lua51-lua_toboolean| returns 1 for any Lua
value different from false and nil; otherwise it returns 0. It also returns 0
when called with a non-valid index. (If you want to accept only actual boolean
values, use |lua51-lua_isboolean| to test the value's type.)

>
    lua_CFunction lua_tocfunction (lua_State *L, int index);
<
Converts a value at the given acceptable index to a C function. That value
must be a C function; otherwise, returns NULL.

>
    lua_Integer lua_tointeger (lua_State *L, int index);
<
Converts the Lua value at the given acceptable index to the signed integral
type |lua51-lua_Integer|. The Lua value must be a number or a string
convertible to a number (see |lua51-sec2.2.1|); otherwise,
|lua51-lua_tointeger| returns 0.
If the number is not an integer, it is truncated in some non-specified way.

>
    const char *lua_tolstring (lua_State *L, int index, size_t *len);
<
Converts the Lua value at the given acceptable index to a C string. If len is
not NULL, it also sets *len with the string length. The Lua value must be a
string or a number; otherwise, the function returns NULL. If the value is a
number, then |lua51-lua_tolstring| also changes the actual value in the stack
to a string. (This change confuses |lua51-lua_next| when |lua51-lua_tolstring|
is applied to keys during a table traversal.)
|lua51-lua_tolstring| returns a fully aligned pointer to a string inside the
Lua state. This string always has a zero ('\0') after its last character (as
in C), but can contain other zeros in its body. Because Lua has garbage
collection, there is no guarantee that the pointer returned by
|lua51-lua_tolstring| will be valid after the corresponding value is removed
from the stack.

>
    lua_Number lua_tonumber (lua_State *L, int index);
<
Converts the Lua value at the given acceptable index to the C type
|lua51-lua_Number| (see |lua51-lua_Number|). The Lua value must be a number or
a string convertible to a number (see |lua51-sec2.2.1|); otherwise,
|lua51-lua_tonumber| returns 0.

>
    const void *lua_topointer (lua_State *L, int index);
<
Converts the value at the given acceptable index to a generic C pointer
(void*). The value can be a userdata, a table, a thread, or a function;
otherwise, |lua51-lua_topointer| returns NULL. Different objects will give
different pointers. There is no way to convert the pointer back to its
original value.
Typically this function is used only for debug information.

>
    lua_State *lua_tothread (lua_State *L, int index);
<
Converts the value at the given acceptable index to a Lua thread (represented
as lua_State*). This value must be a thread; otherwise, the function returns
NULL.

>
    void *lua_touserdata (lua_State *L, int index);

If the value at the given acceptable index is a full userdata, returns its
block address. If the value is a light userdata, returns its pointer.
Otherwise, returns NULL.

>
    int lua_type (lua_State *L, int index);
<
Returns the type of the value in the given acceptable index, or LUA_TNONE for
a non-valid index (that is, an index to an "empty" stack position). The types
returned by |lua51-lua_type| are coded by the following constants defined in
lua.h: LUA_TNIL, LUA_TNUMBER, LUA_TBOOLEAN, LUA_TSTRING, LUA_TTABLE,
LUA_TFUNCTION, LUA_TUSERDATA, LUA_TTHREAD, and LUA_TLIGHTUSERDATA.

    const char *lua_typename  (lua_State *L, int tp);

                               void* ud);
<
The type of the writer function used by |lua51-lua_dump|. Every time it
produces another piece of chunk, |lua51-lua_dump| calls the writer, passing
along the buffer to be written (p), its size (sz), and the data parameter
supplied to |lua51-lua_dump|.
The writer returns an error code: 0 means no errors; any other value means an
error and stops |lua51-lua_dump| from calling the writer again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    void lua_xmove (lua_State *from, lua_State *to, int n);
<
Exchange values between different threads of the same global state.
This function pops n values from the stack from, and pushes them onto the
stack to.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua51-lua_yield*

>
    int lua_yield  (lua_State *L, int nresults);
<
Yields a coroutine.
This function should only be called as the return expression of a C function,
as follows:
>
     return lua_yield (L, nresults);
<
When a C function calls |lua51-lua_yield| in that way, the running coroutine
suspends its execution, and the call to |lua51-lua_resume| that started this
coroutine returns. The parameter nresults is the number of values from the
stack that are passed as results to |lua51-lua_resume|.

3.8  The Debug Interface                                        *lua51-sec3.8*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua has no built-in debugging facilities. Instead, it offers a special
interface by means of functions and hooks. This interface allows the
construction of different kinds of debuggers, profilers, and other tools that
need "inside information" from the interpreter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    } lua_Debug;
<
A structure used to carry different pieces of information about an active
function. |lua51-lua_getstack| fills only the private part of this structure,
for later use. To fill the other fields of |lua51-lua_Debug| with useful
information, call |lua51-lua_getinfo|.
The fields of |lua51-lua_Debug| have the following meaning:
- source: If the function was defined in a string, then source is that string.
  If the function was defined in a file, then source starts with a '@'
  followed by the file name.
- short_src: a "printable" version of source, to be used in error messages.
- linedefined: the line number where the definition of the function starts.
- lastlinedefined: the line number where the definition of the function ends.
- what: the string "Lua" if the function is a Lua function, "C" if it is a C
  function, "main" if it is the main part of a chunk, and "tail" if it was a
  function that did a tail call. In the latter case, Lua has no other
  information about the function.
- currentline: the current line where the given function is executing. When no
  line information is available, currentline is set to -1.
- name: a reasonable name for the given function. Because functions in Lua are
  first-class values, they do not have a fixed name: some functions can be the
  value of multiple global variables, while others can be stored only in a
  table field. The lua_getinfo function checks how the function was called to
  find a suitable name. If it cannot find a name, then name is set to NULL.
- namewhat: explains the name field. The value of namewhat can be "global",
  "local", "method", "field", "upvalue", or "" (the empty string), according
  to how the function was called. (Lua uses the empty string when no other
  option seems to apply.)
- nups: the number of upvalues of the function.

    int lua_getinfo (lua_State *L, const char *what, lua_Debug *ar);
<
Returns information about a specific function or function invocation.
To get information about a function invocation, the parameter ar must be a
valid activation record that was filled by a previous call to
|lua51-lua_getstack| or given as argument to a hook (see |lua51-lua_Hook|).
To get information about a function you push it onto the stack and start the
what string with the character '>'. (In that case, lua_getinfo pops the
function in the top of the stack.) For instance, to know in which line a
function f was defined, you can write the following code:
>
     lua_Debug ar;
     lua_getfield(L, LUA_GLOBALSINDEX, "f");  /* get global 'f' */
     lua_getinfo(L, ">S", &ar);
     printf("%d\n", ar.linedefined);
<
Each character in the string what selects some fields of the structure ar to
be filled or a value to be pushed on the stack:
- 'n': fills in the field name and namewhat;
- 'S': fills in the fields source, short_src, linedefined, lastlinedefined,
  and what;
- 'l': fills in the field currentline;
- 'u': fills in the field nups;
- 'f': pushes onto the stack the function that is running at the given level;
- 'L': pushes onto the stack a table whose indices are the numbers of the
  lines that are valid on the function. (A valid line is a line with some
  associated code, that is, a line where you can put a break point. Non-valid
  lines include empty lines and comments.)
This function returns 0 on error (for instance, an invalid option in what).

>
    const char *lua_getlocal (lua_State *L, lua_Debug *ar, int n);

Gets information about a local variable of a given activation record. The
parameter ar must be a valid activation record that was filled by a previous
call to |lua51-lua_getstack| or given as argument to a hook (see
|lua51-lua_Hook|). The index n selects which local variable to inspect (1 is
the first parameter or active local variable, and so on, until the last active
local variable). |lua51-lua_getlocal| pushes the variable's value onto the
stack and returns its name.
Variable names starting with '(' (open parentheses) represent internal
variables (loop control variables, temporaries, and C function locals).
Returns NULL (and pushes nothing) when the index is greater than the number of
active local variables.

This function fills parts of a |lua51-lua_Debug| structure with an
identification of the activation record of the function executing at a given
level. Level 0 is the current running function, whereas level n+1 is the
function that has called level n. When there are no errors,
|lua51-lua_getstack| returns 1; when called with a level greater than the
stack depth, it returns 0.

    const char *lua_getupvalue (lua_State *L, int funcindex, int n);
<
Gets information about a closure's upvalue. (For Lua functions, upvalues are
the external local variables that the function uses, and that are consequently
included in its closure.) |lua51-lua_getupvalue| gets the index n of an
upvalue, pushes the upvalue's value onto the stack, and returns its name.
funcindex points to the closure in the stack. (Upvalues have no particular
order, as they are active through the whole function. So, they are numbered in
an arbitrary order.)
Returns NULL (and pushes nothing) when the index is greater than the number of
upvalues. For C functions, this function uses the empty string "" as a name
for all upvalues.

lua_Hook ~
>
    typedef void (*lua_Hook) (lua_State *L, lua_Debug *ar);
<
Type for debugging hook functions.
Whenever a hook is called, its ar argument has its field event set to the
specific event that triggered the hook. Lua identifies these events with the
following constants: LUA_HOOKCALL, LUA_HOOKRET, LUA_HOOKTAILRET, LUA_HOOKLINE,
and LUA_HOOKCOUNT. Moreover, for line events, the field currentline is also
set. To get the value of any other field in ar, the hook must call
|lua51-lua_getinfo|. For return events, event can be LUA_HOOKRET, the normal
value, or LUA_HOOKTAILRET. In the latter case, Lua is simulating a return from
a function that did a tail call; in this case, it is useless to call
|lua51-lua_getinfo|.
While Lua is running a hook, it disables other calls to hooks. Therefore, if a
hook calls back Lua to execute a function or a chunk, this execution occurs
without any calls to hooks.

    int lua_sethook (lua_State *L, lua_Hook f, int mask, int count);
<
Sets the debugging hook function.
Argument f is the hook function. mask specifies on which events the hook will
be called: it is formed by a bitwise or of the constants LUA_MASKCALL,
LUA_MASKRET, LUA_MASKLINE, and LUA_MASKCOUNT. The count argument is only
meaningful when the mask includes LUA_MASKCOUNT. For each event, the hook is
called as explained below:
- The call hook: is called when the interpreter calls a function. The hook is
  called just after Lua enters the new function, before the function gets its
  arguments.
- The return hook: is called when the interpreter returns from a function. The
  hook is called just before Lua leaves the function. You have no access to
  the values to be returned by the function.
- The line hook: is called when the interpreter is about to start the
  execution of a new line of code, or when it jumps back in the code (even to
  the same line). (This event only happens while Lua is executing a Lua
  function.)
- The count hook: is called after the interpreter executes every count
  instructions. (This event only happens while Lua is executing a Lua
  function.)
A hook is disabled by setting mask to zero.

Sets the value of a local variable of a given activation record. Parameters ar
and n are as in |lua51-lua_getlocal| (see |lua51-lua_getlocal|).
|lua51-lua_setlocal| assigns the value at the top of the stack to the variable
and returns its name. It also pops the value from the stack.
Returns NULL (and pops nothing) when the index is greater than the number of
active local variables.

stack. Parameters funcindex and n are as in the |lua51-lua_getupvalue| (see
|lua51-lua_getupvalue|).
Returns NULL (and pops nothing) when the index is greater than the number of
upvalues.

4.  The Auxiliary Library                                         *lua51-sec4*
==============================================================================

The auxiliary library provides several convenient functions to interface C
with Lua. While the basic API provides the primitive functions for all
interactions between C and Lua, the auxiliary library provides higher-level
functions for some common tasks.
All functions from the auxiliary library are defined in header file lauxlib.h
and have a prefix luaL_.
All functions in the auxiliary library are built on top of the basic API, and
so they provide nothing that cannot be done with this API.
Several functions in the auxiliary library are used to check C function
arguments. Their names are always luaL_check* or luaL_opt*. All of these
functions throw an error if the check is not satisfied. Because the error
message is formatted for arguments (e.g., "bad argument #1"), you should not
use these functions for other stack values.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua51-luaL_addsize*

    void luaL_addsize (luaL_Buffer *B, size_t n);

Adds to the buffer B (see |lua51-luaL_Buffer|) a string of length n previously
copied to the buffer area (see |lua51-luaL_prepbuffer|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                        *lua51-luaL_addstring*

>
    void luaL_addstring (luaL_Buffer *B, const char *s);
<
Adds the zero-terminated string pointed to by s to the buffer B (see
|lua51-luaL_Buffer|). The string may not contain embedded zeros.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>
    void luaL_addvalue (luaL_Buffer *B);
<
Adds the value at the top of the stack to the buffer B (see
|lua51-luaL_Buffer|). Pops the value.
This is the only function on string buffers that can (and must) be called with
an extra element on the stack, which is the value to be added to the buffer.

<
Raises an error with the following message, where func is retrieved from the
call stack:

     bad argument # to  ()
<
This function never returns, but it is an idiom to use it in C functions as
return luaL_argerror(args).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *lua51-luaL_Buffer*
luaL_Buffer ~
>
    typedef struct luaL_Buffer luaL_Buffer;
<
Type for a string buffer.
A string buffer allows C code to build Lua strings piecemeal. Its pattern of
use is as follows:
- First you declare a variable b of type |lua51-luaL_Buffer|.
- Then you initialize it with a call luaL_buffinit(L, &b).
- Then you add string pieces to the buffer calling any of the luaL_add*
  functions.
- You finish by calling luaL_pushresult(&b). This call leaves the final string
  on the top of the stack.
During its normal operation, a string buffer uses a variable number of stack
slots. So, while using a buffer, you cannot assume that you know where the top
of the stack is. You can use the stack between successive calls to buffer
operations as long as that use is balanced; that is, when you call a buffer
operation, the stack is at the same level it was immediately after the
previous buffer operation. (The only exception to this rule is
|lua51-luaL_addvalue|.) After calling |lua51-luaL_pushresult| the stack is
back to its level when the buffer was initialized, plus the final string on
its top.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                         *lua51-luaL_buffinit*
luaL_buffinit ~
                                                                   [-0, +0, -]
>
    void luaL_buffinit (lua_State *L, luaL_Buffer *B);
<
Initializes a buffer B. This function does not allocate any space; the buffer
must be declared as a variable (see |lua51-luaL_Buffer|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                         *lua51-luaL_callmeta*

>
    int luaL_callmeta (lua_State *L, int obj, const char *e);
<
Calls a metamethod.
If the object at index obj has a metatable and this metatable has a field e,
this function calls this field and passes the object as its only argument. In
this case this function returns 1 and pushes onto the stack the value returned
by the call. If there is no metatable or no metamethod, this function returns
0 (without pushing any value on the stack).

cast to a long.

>
    const char *luaL_checklstring (lua_State *L, int narg, size_t *l);
<
Checks whether the function argument narg is a string and returns this string;
if l is not NULL fills *l with the string's length.
This function uses |lua51-lua_tolstring| to get its result, so all conversions
and caveats of that function apply here.

                          const char *const lst[]);
<
Checks whether the function argument narg is a string and searches for this
string in the array lst (which must be NULL-terminated). Returns the index in
the array where the string was found. Raises an error if the argument is not a
string or if the string cannot be found.
If def is not NULL, the function uses def as a default value when there is no
argument narg or if this argument is nil.
This is a useful function for mapping strings to C enums. (The usual
convention in Lua libraries is to use strings instead of numbers to select
options.)

Grows the stack size to top + sz elements, raising an error if the stack
cannot grow to that size. msg is an additional text to go into the error
message.

    int luaL_ref (lua_State *L, int t);

Creates and returns a reference, in the table at index t, for the object at
the top of the stack (and pops the object).
A reference is a unique integer key. As long as you do not manually add
integer keys into table t, |lua51-luaL_ref| ensures the uniqueness of the key
it returns. You can retrieve an object referred by reference r by calling
lua_rawgeti(L, t, r). Function |lua51-luaL_unref| frees a reference and its
associated object.
If the object at the top of the stack is nil, |lua51-luaL_ref| returns the
constant LUA_REFNIL. The constant LUA_NOREF is guaranteed to be different from
any reference returned by |lua51-luaL_ref|.

<
Opens a library.
When called with libname equal to NULL, it simply registers all functions in
the list l (see |lua51-luaL_Reg|) into the table on the top of the stack.
When called with a non-null libname, luaL_register creates a new table t, sets
it as the value of the global variable libname, sets it as the value of
package.loaded[libname], and registers on it all functions in the list l. If
there is a table in package.loaded[libname] or in variable libname, reuses
this table instead of creating a new one.

The standard Lua libraries provide useful functions that are implemented
directly through the C API. Some of these functions provide essential services
to the language (e.g., |lua51-type| and |lua51-getmetatable|); others provide
access to "outside" services (e.g., I/O); and others could be implemented in
Lua itself, but are quite useful or have critical performance requirements
that deserve an implementation in C (e.g., |lua51-table.sort|).
All libraries are implemented through the official C API and are provided as
separate C modules. Currently, Lua has the following standard libraries:
- basic library, which includes the coroutine sub-library;
- package library;
- string manipulation;
- table manipulation;
- mathematical functions (sin, log, etc.);
- input and output;
- operating system facilities;
- debug facilities.
Except for the basic and package libraries, each library provides all its
functions as fields of a global table or as methods of its objects.
To have access to these libraries, the C host program should call the
|lua51-luaL_openlibs| function, which opens all standard libraries.
Alternatively, it can open them individually by calling luaopen_base (for the
basic library), luaopen_package (for the package library), luaopen_string (for
the string library), luaopen_table (for the table library), luaopen_math (for
the mathematical library), luaopen_io (for the I/O library), luaopen_os (for
the Operating System library), and luaopen_debug (for the debug library).
These functions are declared in lualib.h and should not be called directly:
you must call them like any other Lua C function, e.g., by using
|lua51-lua_call|.

The basic library provides some core functions to Lua. If you do not include
this library in your application, you should check carefully whether you need
to provide implementations for some of its facilities.

assert (v [, message]) ~

Issues an error when the value of its argument v is false (i.e., nil or
false); otherwise, returns all its arguments. message is an error message;
when absent, it defaults to "assertion failed!"

collectgarbage ([opt [, arg]]) ~

This function is a generic interface to the garbage collector. It performs
different functions according to its first argument, opt:
- "collect": performs a full garbage-collection cycle. This is the default
  option.
- "stop": stops the garbage collector.
- "restart": restarts the garbage collector.
- "count": returns the total memory in use by Lua (in Kbytes).
- "step": performs a garbage-collection step. The step "size" is controlled by
  arg (larger values mean more steps) in a non-specified way. If you want to
  control the step size you must experimentally tune the value of arg. Returns
  true if the step finished a collection cycle.
- "setpause": sets arg as the new value for the pause of the collector (see
  |lua51-sec2.10|). Returns the previous value for pause.
- "setstepmul": sets arg as the new value for the step multiplier of the
  collector (see |lua51-sec2.10|). Returns the previous value for step.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                *lua51-dofile*
dofile ([filename]) ~

Opens the named file and executes its contents as a Lua chunk. When called
without arguments, dofile executes the contents of the standard input (stdin).
Returns all values returned by the chunk. In case of errors, dofile propagates
the error to its caller (that is, dofile does not run in protected mode).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                 *lua51-error*
error (message [, level]) ~

Terminates the last protected function called and returns message as the error
message. Function error never returns.
Usually, error adds some information about the error position at the beginning
of the message. The level argument specifies how to get the error position.
With level 1 (the default), the error position is where the error function was
called. Level 2 points the error to where the function that called error was
called; and so on. Passing a level 0 avoids the addition of error position
information to the message.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                    *lua51-_G*
_G ~

A global variable (not a function) that holds the global environment (that is,
_G._G = _G). Lua itself does not use this variable; changing its value does
not affect any environment, nor vice-versa. (Use |lua51-setfenv| to change
environments.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               *lua51-getfenv*
getfenv ([f]) ~

Returns the current environment in use by the function. f can be a Lua
function or a number that specifies the function at that stack level: Level 1
is the function calling getfenv. If the given function is not a Lua function,
or if f is 0, getfenv returns the global environment. The default for f is 1.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua51-getmetatable*
getmetatable (object) ~

If object does not have a metatable, returns nil. Otherwise, if the object's
metatable has a "__metatable" field, returns the associated value. Otherwise,
returns the metatable of the given object.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                *lua51-ipairs*
ipairs (t) ~

Returns three values: an iterator function, the table t, and 0, so that the
construction
>
     for i,v in ipairs(t) do body end
<
will iterate over the pairs (1,t[1]), (2,t[2]), ..., up to the first integer
key absent from the table.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                  *lua51-load*
load (func [, chunkname]) ~

Loads a chunk using function func to get its pieces. Each call to func must
return a string that concatenates with previous results. A return of an empty
string, nil, or no value signals the end of the chunk.
If there are no errors, returns the compiled chunk as a function; otherwise,
returns nil plus the error message. The environment of the returned function
is the global environment.
chunkname is used as the chunk name for error messages and debug information.
When absent, it defaults to "=(load)".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua51-loadfile*
loadfile ([filename]) ~

Similar to |lua51-load|, but gets the chunk from file filename or from the
standard input, if no file name is given.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua51-loadstring*
loadstring (string [, chunkname]) ~

Similar to |lua51-load|, but gets the chunk from the given string.
To load and run a given string, use the idiom
>
     assert(loadstring(s))()
<
When absent, chunkname defaults to the given string.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                  *lua51-next*
next (table [, index]) ~

Allows a program to traverse all fields of a table. Its first argument is a
table and its second argument is an index in this table. next returns the next
index of the table and its associated value. When called with nil as its
second argument, next returns an initial index and its associated value. When
called with the last index, or with nil in an empty table, next returns nil.
If the second argument is absent, then it is interpreted as nil. In
particular, you can use next(t) to check whether a table is empty.
The order in which the indices are enumerated is not specified, even for
numeric indices. (To traverse a table in numeric order, use a numerical for or
the |lua51-ipairs| function.)
The behavior of next is undefined if, during the traversal, you assign any
value to a non-existent field in the table. You may however modify existing
fields. In particular, you may clear existing fields.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                 *lua51-pairs*
pairs (t) ~

Returns three values: the |lua51-next| function, the table t, and nil, so that
the construction
>
     for k,v in pairs(t) do body end
<
will iterate over all key-value pairs of table t.
See function |lua51-next| for the caveats of modifying the table during its
traversal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                 *lua51-pcall*
pcall (f, arg1, ...) ~

Calls function f with the given arguments in protected mode. This means that
any error inside f is not propagated; instead, pcall catches the error and
returns a status code. Its first result is the status code (a boolean), which
is true if the call succeeds without errors. In such case, pcall also returns
all results from the call, after this first result. In case of any error,
pcall returns false plus the error message.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                 *lua51-print*
print (...) ~

Receives any number of arguments, and prints their values to stdout, using the
|lua51-tostring| function to convert them to strings. print is not intended
for formatted output, but only as a quick way to show a value, typically for
debugging. For formatted output, use |lua51-string.format|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua51-rawequal*
rawequal (v1, v2) ~

Checks whether v1 is equal to v2, without invoking any metamethod. Returns a
boolean.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                *lua51-rawget*
rawget (table, index) ~

Gets the real value of table[index], without invoking any metamethod. table
must be a table; index may be any value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                *lua51-rawset*
rawset (table, index, value) ~

Sets the real value of table[index] to value, without invoking any metamethod.
table must be a table, index any value different from nil, and value any Lua
value.
This function returns table.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                *lua51-select*
select (index, ...) ~

If index is a number, returns all arguments after argument number index.
Otherwise, index must be the string "#", and select returns the total number
of extra arguments it received.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               *lua51-setfenv*
setfenv (f, table) ~

Sets the environment to be used by the given function. f can be a Lua function
or a number that specifies the function at that stack level: Level 1 is the
function calling setfenv. setfenv returns the given function.
As a special case, when f is 0 setfenv changes the environment of the running
thread. In this case, setfenv returns no values.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua51-setmetatable*
setmetatable (table, metatable) ~

Sets the metatable for the given table. (You cannot change the metatable of
other types from Lua, only from C.) If metatable is nil, removes the metatable
of the given table. If the original metatable has a "__metatable" field,
raises an error.
This function returns table.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua51-tonumber*
tonumber (e [, base]) ~

Tries to convert its argument to a number. If the argument is already a number
or a string convertible to a number, then tonumber returns this number;
otherwise, it returns nil.
An optional argument specifies the base to interpret the numeral. The base may
be any integer between 2 and 36, inclusive. In bases above 10, the letter 'A'
(in either upper or lower case) represents 10, 'B' represents 11, and so
forth, with 'Z' representing 35. In base 10 (the default), the number can have
a decimal part, as well as an optional exponent part (see |lua51-sec2.1|). In
other bases, only unsigned integers are accepted.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua51-tostring*
tostring (e) ~

Receives an argument of any type and converts it to a string in a reasonable
format. For complete control of how numbers are converted, use
|lua51-string.format|.
If the metatable of e has a "__tostring" field, then tostring calls the
corresponding value with e as argument, and uses the result of the call as its
result.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                  *lua51-type*
type (v) ~

Returns the type of its only argument, coded as a string. The possible results
of this function are "nil" (a string, not the value nil), "number", "string",
"boolean", "table", "function", "thread", and "userdata".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                *lua51-unpack*
unpack (list [, i [, j]]) ~

Returns the elements from the given table. This function is equivalent to
>
     return list[i], list[i+1], ..., list[j]
<
except that the above code can be written only for a fixed number of elements.
By default, i is 1 and j is the length of the list, as defined by the length
operator (see |lua51-sec2.5.5|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua51-_VERSION*
_VERSION ~

A global variable (not a function) that holds a string containing the current
interpreter version. The current contents of this variable is "Lua 5.1".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                *lua51-xpcall*
xpcall (f, err) ~

This function is similar to |lua51-pcall|, except that you can set a new error
handler.
xpcall calls function f in protected mode, using err as the error handler. Any
error inside f is not propagated; instead, xpcall catches the error, calls the
err function with the original error object, and returns a status code. Its
first result is the status code (a boolean), which is true if the call
succeeds without errors. In this case, xpcall also returns all results from
the call, after this first result. In case of any error, xpcall returns false
plus the result from err.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.2  Coroutine Manipulation                                     *lua51-sec5.2*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The operations related to coroutines comprise a sub-library of the basic
library and come inside the table coroutine. See |lua51-sec2.11| for a general
description of coroutines.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                      *lua51-coroutine.create*
coroutine.create (f) ~

Creates a new coroutine, with body f. f must be a Lua function. Returns this
new coroutine, an object with type "thread".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                      *lua51-coroutine.resume*
coroutine.resume (co [, val1, ...]) ~

Starts or continues the execution of coroutine co. The first time you resume a
coroutine, it starts running its body. The values val1, ... are passed as the
arguments to the body function. If the coroutine has yielded, resume restarts
it; the values val1, ... are passed as the results from the yield.
If the coroutine runs without any errors, resume returns true plus any values
passed to yield (if the coroutine yields) or any values returned by the body
function (if the coroutine terminates). If there is any error, resume returns
false plus the error message.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                     *lua51-coroutine.running*
coroutine.running () ~

Returns the running coroutine, or nil when called by the main thread.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                      *lua51-coroutine.status*
coroutine.status (co) ~

Returns the status of coroutine co, as a string: "running", if the coroutine
is running (that is, it called status); "suspended", if the coroutine is
suspended in a call to yield, or if it has not started running yet; "normal"
if the coroutine is active but not running (that is, it has resumed another
coroutine); and "dead" if the coroutine has finished its body function, or if
it has stopped with an error.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                        *lua51-coroutine.wrap*
coroutine.wrap (f) ~

Creates a new coroutine, with body f. f must be a Lua function. Returns a
function that resumes the coroutine each time it is called. Any arguments
passed to the function behave as the extra arguments to resume. Returns the
same values returned by resume, except the first boolean. In case of error,
propagates the error.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                       *lua51-coroutine.yield*
coroutine.yield (...) ~

Suspends the execution of the calling coroutine. The coroutine cannot be
running a C function, a metamethod, or an iterator. Any arguments to yield are
passed as extra results to resume.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.3  Modules                                                    *lua51-sec5.3*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The package library provides basic facilities for loading and building modules
in Lua. It exports two of its functions directly in the global environment:
|lua51-require| and |lua51-module|. Everything else is exported in a table
package.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                *lua51-module*
module (name [, ...]) ~

Creates a module. If there is a table in package.loaded[name], this table is
the module. Otherwise, if there is a global table t with the given name, this
table is the module. Otherwise creates a new table t and sets it as the value
of the global name and the value of package.loaded[name]. This function also
initializes t._NAME with the given name, t._M with the module (t itself), and
t._PACKAGE with the package name (the full module name minus last component;
see below). Finally, module sets t as the new environment of the current
function and the new value of package.loaded[name], so that |lua51-require|
returns t.
If name is a compound name (that is, one with components separated by dots),
module creates (or reuses, if they already exist) tables for each component.
For instance, if name is a.b.c, then module stores the module table in field c
of field b of global a.
This function can receive optional options after the module name, where each
option is a function to be applied over the module.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               *lua51-require*
require (modname) ~

Loads the given module. The function starts by looking into the
|lua51-package.loaded| table to determine whether modname is already loaded.
If it is, then require returns the value stored at package.loaded[modname].
Otherwise, it tries to find a loader for the module.
To find a loader, require is guided by the |lua51-package.loaders| array. By
changing this array, we can change how require looks for a module. The
following explanation is based on the default configuration for
|lua51-package.loaders|.
First require queries package.preload[modname]. If it has a value, this value
(which should be a function) is the loader. Otherwise require searches for a
Lua loader using the path stored in |lua51-package.path|. If that also fails,
it searches for a C loader using the path stored in |lua51-package.cpath|. If
that also fails, it tries an all-in-one loader (see |lua51-package.loaders|).
Once a loader is found, require calls the loader with a single argument,
modname. If the loader returns any value, require assigns the returned value
to package.loaded[modname]. If the loader returns no value and has not
assigned any value to package.loaded[modname], then require assigns true to
this entry. In any case, require returns the final value of
package.loaded[modname].
If there is any error loading or running the module, or if it cannot find any
loader for the module, then require signals an error.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua51-LUA_CPATH*
                                                         *lua51-package.cpath*
package.cpath ~

The path used by |lua51-require| to search for a C loader.
Lua initializes the C path |lua51-package.cpath| in the same way it
initializes the Lua path |lua51-package.path|, using the environment variable
LUA_CPATH or a default path defined in luaconf.h.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                        *lua51-package.loaded*
package.loaded ~

A table used by |lua51-require| to control which modules are already loaded.
When you require a module modname and package.loaded[modname] is not false,
|lua51-require| simply returns the value stored there.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                       *lua51-package.loaders*
package.loaders ~

A table used by |lua51-require| to control how to load modules.
Each entry in this table is a searcher function. When looking for a module,
|lua51-require| calls each of these searchers in ascending order, with the
module name (the argument given to |lua51-require|) as its sole parameter. The
function can return another function (the module loader) or a string
explaining why it did not find that module (or nil if it has nothing to say).
Lua initializes this table with four functions.
The first searcher simply looks for a loader in the |lua51-package.preload|
table.
The second searcher looks for a loader as a Lua library, using the path stored
at |lua51-package.path|. A path is a sequence of templates separated by
semicolons. For each template, the searcher will change each interrogation
mark in the template by filename, which is the module name with each dot
replaced by a "directory separator" (such as "/" in Unix); then it will try to
open the resulting file name. So, for instance, if the Lua path is the string
>
     "./?.lua;./?.lc;/usr/local/?/init.lua"
<
the search for a Lua file for module foo will try to open the files ./foo.lua,
./foo.lc, and /usr/local/foo/init.lua, in that order.
The third searcher looks for a loader as a C library, using the path given by
the variable |lua51-package.cpath|. For instance, if the C path is the string
>
     "./?.so;./?.dll;/usr/local/?/init.so"
<
the searcher for module foo will try to open the files ./foo.so, ./foo.dll,
and /usr/local/foo/init.so, in that order. Once it finds a C library, this
searcher first uses a dynamic link facility to link the application with the
library. Then it tries to find a C function inside the library to be used as
the loader. The name of this C function is the string "luaopen_" concatenated
with a copy of the module name where each dot is replaced by an underscore.
Moreover, if the module name has a hyphen, its prefix up to (and including)
the first hyphen is removed. For instance, if the module name is a.v1-b.c, the
function name will be luaopen_b_c.
The fourth searcher tries an all-in-one loader. It searches the C path for a
library for the root name of the given module. For instance, when requiring
a.b.c, it will search for a C library for a. If found, it looks into it for an
open function for the submodule; in our example, that would be luaopen_a_b_c.
With this facility, a package can pack several C submodules into one single
library, with each submodule keeping its original open function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                       *lua51-package.loadlib*
package.loadlib (libname, funcname) ~

Dynamically links the host program with the C library libname. Inside this
library, looks for a function funcname and returns this function as a C
function. (So, funcname must follow the protocol (see |lua51-lua_CFunction|)).
This is a low-level function. It completely bypasses the package and module
system. Unlike |lua51-require|, it does not perform any path searching and
does not automatically adds extensions. libname must be the complete file name
of the C library, including if necessary a path and extension. funcname must
be the exact name exported by the C library (which may depend on the C
compiler and linker used).
This function is not supported by ANSI C. As such, it is only available on
some platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, BSD, plus other Unix
systems that support the dlfcn standard).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua51-LUA_PATH*
                                                          *lua51-package.path*
package.path ~

The path used by |lua51-require| to search for a Lua loader.
At start-up, Lua initializes this variable with the value of the environment
variable LUA_PATH or with a default path defined in luaconf.h, if the
environment variable is not defined. Any ";;" in the value of the environment
variable is replaced by the default path.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                       *lua51-package.preload*
package.preload ~

A table to store loaders for specific modules (see |lua51-require|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                        *lua51-package.seeall*
package.seeall (module) ~

Sets a metatable for module with its __index field referring to the global
environment, so that this module inherits values from the global environment.
To be used as an option to function |lua51-module|.

5.4  String Manipulation                                        *lua51-sec5.4*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library provides generic functions for string manipulation, such as
finding and extracting substrings, and pattern matching. When indexing a
string in Lua, the first character is at position 1 (not at 0, as in C).
Indices are allowed to be negative and are interpreted as indexing backwards,
from the end of the string. Thus, the last character is at position -1, and so
on.
The string library provides all its functions inside the table string. It also
sets a metatable for strings where the __index field points to the string
table. Therefore, you can use the string functions in object-oriented style.
For instance, string.byte(s, i) can be written as s:byte(i).
The string library assumes one-byte character encodings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *lua51-string.byte*
string.byte (s [, i [, j]]) ~

Returns the internal numerical codes of the characters s[i], s[i+1], ...,
s[j]. The default value for i is 1; the default value for j is i.
Note that numerical codes are not necessarily portable across platforms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *lua51-string.char*
string.char (...) ~

Receives zero or more integers. Returns a string with length equal to the
number of arguments, in which each character has the internal numerical code
equal to its corresponding argument.
Note that numerical codes are not necessarily portable across platforms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *lua51-string.dump*
string.dump (function) ~

Returns a string containing a binary representation of the given function, so
that a later |lua51-loadstring| on this string returns a copy of the function.
function must be a Lua function without upvalues.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *lua51-string.find*
string.find (s, pattern [, init [, plain]]) ~

Looks for the first match of pattern in the string s. If it finds a match,
then find returns the indices of s where this occurrence starts and ends;
otherwise, it returns nil. A third, optional numerical argument init specifies
where to start the search; its default value is 1 and can be negative. A value
of true as a fourth, optional argument plain turns off the pattern matching
facilities, so the function does a plain "find substring" operation, with no
characters in pattern being considered "magic". Note that if plain is given,
then init must be given as well.
If the pattern has captures, then in a successful match the captured values
are also returned, after the two indices.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                         *lua51-string.format*
string.format (formatstring, ...) ~

Returns a formatted version of its variable number of arguments following the
description given in its first argument (which must be a string). The format
string follows the same rules as the printf family of standard C functions.
The only differences are that the options/modifiers *, l, L, n, p, and h are
not supported and that there is an extra option, q. The q option formats a
string in a form suitable to be safely read back by the Lua interpreter: the
string is written between double quotes, and all double quotes, newlines,
embedded zeros, and backslashes in the string are correctly escaped when
written. For instance, the call
>
     string.format('%q', 'a string with "quotes" and \n new line')
<
will produce the string:
>
     "a string with \"quotes\" and \
      new line"
<
The options c, d, E, e, f, g, G, i, o, u, X, and x all expect a number as
argument, whereas q and s expect a string.
This function does not accept string values containing embedded zeros, except
as arguments to the q option.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                         *lua51-string.gmatch*
string.gmatch (s, pattern) ~

Returns an iterator function that, each time it is called, returns the next
captures from pattern over string s. If pattern specifies no captures, then
the whole match is produced in each call.
As an example, the following loop
>
     s = "hello world from Lua"
     for w in string.gmatch(s, "%a+") do
       print(w)
     end
<
will iterate over all the words from string s, printing one per line. The next
example collects all pairs key=value from the given string into a table:
>
     t = {}
     s = "from=world, to=Lua"
     for k, v in string.gmatch(s, "(%w+)=(%w+)") do
       t[k] = v
     end
<
For this function, a '^' at the start of a pattern does not work as an anchor,
as this would prevent the iteration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *lua51-string.gsub*
string.gsub (s, pattern, repl [, n]) ~

Returns a copy of s in which all (or the first n, if given) occurrences of the
pattern have been replaced by a replacement string specified by repl, which
can be a string, a table, or a function. gsub also returns, as its second
value, the total number of matches that occurred.
If repl is a string, then its value is used for replacement. The character %
works as an escape character: any sequence in repl of the form %n, with n
between 1 and 9, stands for the value of the n-th captured substring (see
below). The sequence %0 stands for the whole match. The sequence %% stands for
a single %.
If repl is a table, then the table is queried for every match, using the first
capture as the key; if the pattern specifies no captures, then the whole match
is used as the key.
If repl is a function, then this function is called every time a match occurs,
with all captured substrings passed as arguments, in order; if the pattern
specifies no captures, then the whole match is passed as a sole argument.
If the value returned by the table query or by the function call is a string
or a number, then it is used as the replacement string; otherwise, if it is
false or nil, then there is no replacement (that is, the original match is
kept in the string).
Here are some examples:
>
     x = string.gsub("hello world", "(%w+)", "%1 %1")
     --> x="hello hello world world"
     
     x = string.gsub("hello world", "%w+", "%0 %0", 1)
     --> x="hello hello world"
     
     x = string.gsub("hello world from Lua", "(%w+)%s*(%w+)", "%2 %1")
     --> x="world hello Lua from"
     
     x = string.gsub("home = $HOME, user = $USER", "%$(%w+)", os.getenv)
     --> x="home = /home/roberto, user = roberto"
     
     x = string.gsub("4+5 = $return 4+5$", "%$(.-)%$", function (s)
           return loadstring(s)()
         end)
     --> x="4+5 = 9"
     
     local t = {name="lua", version="5.1"}
     x = string.gsub("$name-$version.tar.gz", "%$(%w+)", t)
     --> x="lua-5.1.tar.gz"
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua51-string.len*
string.len (s) ~

Receives a string and returns its length. The empty string "" has length 0.
Embedded zeros are counted, so "a\000bc\000" has length 5.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua51-string.lower*
string.lower (s) ~

Receives a string and returns a copy of this string with all uppercase letters
changed to lowercase. All other characters are left unchanged. The definition
of what an uppercase letter is depends on the current locale.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua51-string.match*
string.match (s, pattern [, init]) ~

Looks for the first match of pattern in the string s. If it finds one, then
match returns the captures from the pattern; otherwise it returns nil. If
pattern specifies no captures, then the whole match is returned. A third,
optional numerical argument init specifies where to start the search; its
default value is 1 and can be negative.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua51-string.rep*
string.rep (s, n) ~

Returns a string that is the concatenation of n copies of the string s.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                        *lua51-string.reverse*
string.reverse (s) ~

Returns a string that is the string s reversed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua51-string.sub*
string.sub (s, i [, j]) ~

Returns the substring of s that starts at i and continues until j; i and j can
be negative. If j is absent, then it is assumed to be equal to -1 (which is
the same as the string length). In particular, the call string.sub(s,1,j)
returns a prefix of s with length j, and string.sub(s, -i) returns a suffix of
s with length i.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua51-string.upper*
string.upper (s) ~

Receives a string and returns a copy of this string with all lowercase letters
changed to uppercase. All other characters are left unchanged. The definition
of what a lowercase letter is depends on the current locale.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.4.1  Patterns                                               *lua51-sec5.4.1*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Character Class:
A character class is used to represent a set of characters. The following
combinations are allowed in describing a character class:
- x: (where x is not one of the magic characters ^$()%.[]*+-?) represents the
  character x itself.
- .: (a dot) represents all characters.
- %a: represents all letters.
- %c: represents all control characters.
- %d: represents all digits.
- %l: represents all lowercase letters.
- %p: represents all punctuation characters.
- %s: represents all space characters.
- %u: represents all uppercase letters.
- %w: represents all alphanumeric characters.
- %x: represents all hexadecimal digits.
- %z: represents the character with representation 0.
- %x: (where x is any non-alphanumeric character) represents the character x.
  This is the standard way to escape the magic characters. Any punctuation
  character (even the non magic) can be preceded by a '%' when used to
  represent itself in a pattern.
- [set]: represents the class which is the union of all characters in set. A
  range of characters can be specified by separating the end characters of the
  range with a '-'. All classes %x described above can also be used as
  components in set. All other characters in set represent themselves. For
  example, [%w_] (or [_%w]) represents all alphanumeric characters plus the
  underscore, [0-7] represents the octal digits, and [0-7%l%-] represents the
  octal digits plus the lowercase letters plus the '-' character.
  The interaction between ranges and classes is not defined. Therefore,
  patterns like [%a-z] or [a-%%] have no meaning.
- [^set]: represents the complement of set, where set is interpreted as above.
For all classes represented by single letters (%a, %c, etc.), the
corresponding uppercase letter represents the complement of the class. For
instance, %S represents all non-space characters.
The definitions of letter, space, and other character groups depend on the
current locale. In particular, the class [a-z] may not be equivalent to %l.
Pattern Item:
A pattern item can be
- a single character class, which matches any single character in the class;
- a single character class followed by '*', which matches 0 or more
  repetitions of characters in the class. These repetition items will always
  match the longest possible sequence;
- a single character class followed by '+', which matches 1 or more
  repetitions of characters in the class. These repetition items will always
  match the longest possible sequence;
- a single character class followed by '-', which also matches 0 or more
  repetitions of characters in the class. Unlike '*', these repetition items
  will always match the shortest possible sequence;
- a single character class followed by '?', which matches 0 or 1 occurrence of
  a character in the class;
- %n, for n between 1 and 9; such item matches a substring equal to the n-th
  captured string (see below);
- %bxy, where x and y are two distinct characters; such item matches strings
  that start with x, end with y, and where the x and y are balanced. This
  means that, if one reads the string from left to right, counting +1 for an x
  and -1 for a y, the ending y is the first y where the count reaches 0. For
  instance, the item %b() matches expressions with balanced parentheses.
Pattern:
A pattern is a sequence of pattern items. A '^' at the beginning of a pattern
anchors the match at the beginning of the subject string. A '$' at the end of
a pattern anchors the match at the end of the subject string. At other
positions, '^' and '$' have no special meaning and represent themselves.
Captures:
A pattern can contain sub-patterns enclosed in parentheses; they describe
captures. When a match succeeds, the substrings of the subject string that
match captures are stored (captured) for future use. Captures are numbered
according to their left parentheses. For instance, in the pattern
"(a*(.)%w(%s*))", the part of the string matching "a*(.)%w(%s*)" is stored as
the first capture (and therefore has number 1); the character matching "." is
captured with number 2, and the part matching "%s*" has number 3.
As a special case, the empty capture () captures the current string position
(a number). For instance, if we apply the pattern "()aa()" on the string
"flaaap", there will be two captures: 3 and 5.
A pattern cannot contain embedded zeros. Use %z instead.

5.5  Table Manipulation                                         *lua51-sec5.5*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library provides generic functions for table manipulation. It provides
all its functions inside the table table.
Most functions in the table library assume that the table represents an array
or a list. For these functions, when we talk about the "length" of a table we
mean the result of the length operator.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua51-table.concat*
table.concat (table [, sep [, i [, j]]]) ~

Given an array where all elements are strings or numbers, returns
table[i]..sep..table[i+1] ... sep..table[j]. The default value for sep is the
empty string, the default for i is 1, and the default for j is the length of
the table. If i is greater than j, returns the empty string.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua51-table.insert*
table.insert (table, [pos,] value) ~

Inserts element value at position pos in table, shifting up other elements to
open space, if necessary. The default value for pos is n+1, where n is the
length of the table (see |lua51-sec2.5.5|), so that a call table.insert(t,x)
inserts x at the end of table t.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua51-table.maxn*
table.maxn (table) ~

Returns the largest positive numerical index of the given table, or zero if
the table has no positive numerical indices. (To do its job this function does
a linear traversal of the whole table.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua51-table.remove*
table.remove (table [, pos]) ~

Removes from table the element at position pos, shifting down other elements
to close the space, if necessary. Returns the value of the removed element.
The default value for pos is n, where n is the length of the table, so that a
call table.remove(t) removes the last element of table t.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua51-table.sort*
table.sort (table [, comp]) ~

Sorts table elements in a given order, in-place, from table[1] to table[n],
where n is the length of the table. If comp is given, then it must be a
function that receives two table elements, and returns true when the first is
less than the second (so that not comp(a[i+1],a[i]) will be true after the
sort). If comp is not given, then the standard Lua operator < is used instead.
The sort algorithm is not stable; that is, elements considered equal by the
given order may have their relative positions changed by the sort.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.6  Mathematical Functions                                     *lua51-sec5.6*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library is an interface to the standard C math library. It provides all
its functions inside the table math.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua51-math.abs*
math.abs (x) ~

Returns the absolute value of x.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua51-math.acos*
math.acos (x) ~

Returns the arc cosine of x (in radians).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua51-math.asin*
math.asin (x) ~

Returns the arc sine of x (in radians).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua51-math.atan*
math.atan (x) ~

Returns the arc tangent of x (in radians).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua51-math.atan2*
math.atan2 (y, x) ~

Returns the arc tangent of y/x (in radians), but uses the signs of both
parameters to find the quadrant of the result. (It also handles correctly the
case of x being zero.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua51-math.ceil*
math.ceil (x) ~

Returns the smallest integer larger than or equal to x.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua51-math.cos*
math.cos (x) ~

Returns the cosine of x (assumed to be in radians).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua51-math.cosh*
math.cosh (x) ~

Returns the hyperbolic cosine of x.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua51-math.deg*
math.deg (x) ~

Returns the angle x (given in radians) in degrees.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua51-math.exp*
math.exp (x) ~

Returns the value ex.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua51-math.floor*
math.floor (x) ~

Returns the largest integer smaller than or equal to x.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua51-math.fmod*
math.fmod (x, y) ~

Returns the remainder of the division of x by y that rounds the quotient
towards zero.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua51-math.frexp*
math.frexp (x) ~

Returns m and e such that x = m2e, e is an integer and the absolute value of m
is in the range [0.5, 1) (or zero when x is zero).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua51-math.huge*
math.huge ~

The value HUGE_VAL, a value larger than or equal to any other numerical value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua51-math.ldexp*

math.log10 (x) ~

Returns the base-10 logarithm of x.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua51-math.max*
math.max (x, ...) ~

Returns the maximum value among its arguments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua51-math.min*
math.min (x, ...) ~

Returns the minimum value among its arguments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

math.modf (x) ~

Returns two numbers, the integral part of x and the fractional part of x.

                                                               *lua51-math.pi*
math.pi ~

The value of pi.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua51-math.pow*
math.pow (x, y) ~

Returns xy. (You can also use the expression x^y to compute this value.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua51-math.rad*
math.rad (x) ~

Returns the angle x (given in degrees) in radians.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *lua51-math.random*
math.random ([m [, n]]) ~

This function is an interface to the simple pseudo-random generator function
rand provided by ANSI C. (No guarantees can be given for its statistical
properties.)
When called without arguments, returns a uniform pseudo-random real number in
the range [0,1). When called with an integer number m, math.random returns a
uniform pseudo-random integer in the range [1, m]. When called with two
integer numbers m and n, math.random returns a uniform pseudo-random integer
in the range [m, n].

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                       *lua51-math.randomseed*
math.randomseed (x) ~

Sets x as the "seed" for the pseudo-random generator: equal seeds produce
equal sequences of numbers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua51-math.sin*
math.sin (x) ~

Returns the sine of x (assumed to be in radians).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua51-math.sinh*
math.sinh (x) ~

Returns the hyperbolic sine of x.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua51-math.sqrt*
math.sqrt (x) ~

Returns the square root of x. (You can also use the expression x^0.5 to
compute this value.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua51-math.tan*
math.tan (x) ~

Returns the tangent of x (assumed to be in radians).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua51-math.tanh*
math.tanh (x) ~

Returns the hyperbolic tangent of x.

5.7  Input and Output Facilities                                *lua51-sec5.7*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              *lua51-io.stdin*
                                                             *lua51-io.stdout*
                                                             *lua51-io.stderr*

The I/O library provides two different styles for file manipulation. The first
one uses implicit file descriptors; that is, there are operations to set a
default input file and a default output file, and all input/output operations
are over these default files. The second style uses explicit file descriptors.
When using implicit file descriptors, all operations are supplied by table io.
When using explicit file descriptors, the operation |lua51-io.open| returns a
file descriptor and then all operations are supplied as methods of the file
descriptor.
The table io also provides three predefined file descriptors with their usual
meanings from C: io.stdin, io.stdout, and io.stderr. The I/O library never
closes these files.
Unless otherwise stated, all I/O functions return nil on failure (plus an
error message as a second result and a system-dependent error code as a third
result) and some value different from nil on success.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua51-io.close*
io.close ([file]) ~

Equivalent to file:close(). Without a file, closes the default output file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua51-io.flush*
io.flush () ~

Equivalent to file:flush over the default output file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua51-io.input*
io.input ([file]) ~

When called with a file name, it opens the named file (in text mode), and sets
its handle as the default input file. When called with a file handle, it
simply sets this file handle as the default input file. When called without
parameters, it returns the current default input file.
In case of errors this function raises the error, instead of returning an
error code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua51-io.lines*
io.lines ([filename]) ~

Opens the given file name in read mode and returns an iterator function that,
each time it is called, returns a new line from the file. Therefore, the
construction
>
     for line in io.lines(filename) do body end
<
will iterate over all lines of the file. When the iterator function detects
the end of file, it returns nil (to finish the loop) and automatically closes
the file.
The call io.lines() (with no file name) is equivalent to io.input():lines();
that is, it iterates over the lines of the default input file. In this case it
does not close the file when the loop ends.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               *lua51-io.open*
io.open (filename [, mode]) ~

This function opens a file, in the mode specified in the string mode. It
returns a new file handle, or, in case of errors, nil plus an error message.
The mode string can be any of the following:
- "r": read mode (the default);
- "w": write mode;
- "a": append mode;
- "r+": update mode, all previous data is preserved;
- "w+": update mode, all previous data is erased;
- "a+": append update mode, previous data is preserved, writing is only
  allowed at the end of file.
The mode string can also have a 'b' at the end, which is needed in some
systems to open the file in binary mode. This string is exactly what is used
in the standard C function fopen.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua51-io.output*
io.output ([file]) ~

Similar to |lua51-io.input|, but operates over the default output file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua51-io.popen*
io.popen (prog [, mode]) ~

Starts program prog in a separated process and returns a file handle that you
can use to read data from this program (if mode is "r", the default) or to
write data to this program (if mode is "w").
This function is system dependent and is not available on all platforms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               *lua51-io.read*
io.read (...) ~

Equivalent to io.input():read.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua51-io.tmpfile*
io.tmpfile () ~

Returns a handle for a temporary file. This file is opened in update mode and
it is automatically removed when the program ends.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               *lua51-io.type*
io.type (obj) ~

Checks whether obj is a valid file handle. Returns the string "file" if obj is
an open file handle, "closed file" if obj is a closed file handle, or nil if
obj is not a file handle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua51-io.write*
io.write (...) ~

Equivalent to io.output():write.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua51-file:close*
file:close () ~

Closes file. Note that files are automatically closed when their handles are
garbage collected, but that takes an unpredictable amount of time to happen.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua51-file:flush*
file:flush () ~

Saves any written data to file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua51-file:lines*
file:lines () ~

Returns an iterator function that, each time it is called, returns a new line
from the file. Therefore, the construction
>
     for line in file:lines() do body end
<
will iterate over all lines of the file. (Unlike |lua51-io.lines|, this
function does not close the file when the loop ends.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua51-file:read*
file:read (...) ~

Reads the file file, according to the given formats, which specify what to
read. For each format, the function returns a string (or a number) with the
characters read, or nil if it cannot read data with the specified format. When
called without formats, it uses a default format that reads the entire next
line (see below).
The available formats are
- "*n": reads a number; this is the only format that returns a number instead
  of a string.
- "*a": reads the whole file, starting at the current position. On end of
  file, it returns the empty string.
- "*l": reads the next line (skipping the end of line), returning nil on end
  of file. This is the default format.
- number: reads a string with up to this number of characters, returning nil
  on end of file. If number is zero, it reads nothing and returns an empty
  string, or nil on end of file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua51-file:seek*
file:seek ([whence] [, offset]) ~

Sets and gets the file position, measured from the beginning of the file, to
the position given by offset plus a base specified by the string whence, as
follows:
- "set": base is position 0 (beginning of the file);
- "cur": base is current position;
- "end": base is end of file;
In case of success, function seek returns the final file position, measured in
bytes from the beginning of the file. If this function fails, it returns nil,
plus a string describing the error.
The default value for whence is "cur", and for offset is 0. Therefore, the
call file:seek() returns the current file position, without changing it; the
call file:seek("set") sets the position to the beginning of the file (and
returns 0); and the call file:seek("end") sets the position to the end of the
file, and returns its size.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua51-file:setvbuf*
file:setvbuf (mode [, size]) ~

Sets the buffering mode for an output file. There are three available modes:
- "no": no buffering; the result of any output operation appears immediately.
- "full": full buffering; output operation is performed only when the buffer
  is full (or when you explicitly flush the file (see |lua51-io.flush|)).
- "line": line buffering; output is buffered until a newline is output or
  there is any input from some special files (such as a terminal device).
For the last two cases, size specifies the size of the buffer, in bytes. The
default is an appropriate size.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua51-file:write*
file:write (...) ~

Writes the value of each of its arguments to the file. The arguments must be
strings or numbers. To write other values, use |lua51-tostring| or
|lua51-string.format| before write.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.8  Operating System Facilities                                *lua51-sec5.8*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library is implemented through table os.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua51-os.clock*
os.clock () ~

Returns an approximation of the amount in seconds of CPU time used by the
program.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               *lua51-os.date*
os.date ([format [, time]]) ~

Returns a string or a table containing date and time, formatted according to
the given string format.
If the time argument is present, this is the time to be formatted (see the
|lua51-os.time| function for a description of this value). Otherwise, date
formats the current time.
If format starts with '!', then the date is formatted in Coordinated Universal
Time. After this optional character, if format is the string "*t", then date
returns a table with the following fields: year (four digits), month (1--12),
day (1--31), hour (0--23), min (0--59), sec (0--61), wday (weekday, Sunday is
1), yday (day of the year), and isdst (daylight saving flag, a boolean).
If format is not "*t", then date returns the date as a string, formatted
according to the same rules as the C function strftime.
When called without arguments, date returns a reasonable date and time
representation that depends on the host system and on the current locale (that
is, os.date() is equivalent to os.date("%c")).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *lua51-os.difftime*
os.difftime (t2, t1) ~

Returns the number of seconds from time t1 to time t2. In POSIX, Windows, and
some other systems, this value is exactly t2-t1.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua51-os.execute*
os.execute ([command]) ~

This function is equivalent to the C function system. It passes command to be
executed by an operating system shell. It returns a status code, which is
system-dependent. If command is absent, then it returns nonzero if a shell is
available and zero otherwise.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               *lua51-os.exit*
os.exit ([code]) ~

Calls the C function exit, with an optional code, to terminate the host
program. The default value for code is the success code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua51-os.getenv*
os.getenv (varname) ~

Returns the value of the process environment variable varname, or nil if the
variable is not defined.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua51-os.remove*
os.remove (filename) ~

Deletes the file or directory with the given name. Directories must be empty
to be removed. If this function fails, it returns nil, plus a string
describing the error.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua51-os.rename*
os.rename (oldname, newname) ~

Renames file or directory named oldname to newname. If this function fails, it
returns nil, plus a string describing the error.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua51-os.setlocale*
os.setlocale (locale [, category]) ~

Sets the current locale of the program. locale is a string specifying a
locale; category is an optional string describing which category to change:
"all", "collate", "ctype", "monetary", "numeric", or "time"; the default
category is "all". The function returns the name of the new locale, or nil if
the request cannot be honored.
If locale is the empty string, the current locale is set to an
implementation-defined native locale. If locale is the string "C", the current
locale is set to the standard C locale.
When called with nil as the first argument, this function only returns the
name of the current locale for the given category.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               *lua51-os.time*
os.time ([table]) ~

Returns the current time when called without arguments, or a time representing
the date and time specified by the given table. This table must have fields
year, month, and day, and may have fields hour, min, sec, and isdst (for a
description of these fields, see the |lua51-os.date| function).
The returned value is a number, whose meaning depends on your system. In
POSIX, Windows, and some other systems, this number counts the number of
seconds since some given start time (the "epoch"). In other systems, the
meaning is not specified, and the number returned by time can be used only as
an argument to date and difftime.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua51-os.tmpname*
os.tmpname () ~

Returns a string with a file name that can be used for a temporary file. The
file must be explicitly opened before its use and explicitly removed when no
longer needed.
On some systems (POSIX), this function also creates a file with that name, to
avoid security risks. (Someone else might create the file with wrong
permissions in the time between getting the name and creating the file.) You
still have to open the file to use it and to remove it (even if you do not use
it).
When possible, you may prefer to use |lua51-io.tmpfile|, which automatically
removes the file when the program ends.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.9  The Debug Library                                          *lua51-sec5.9*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library provides the functionality of the debug interface to Lua
programs. You should exert care when using this library. The functions
provided here should be used exclusively for debugging and similar tasks, such
as profiling. Please resist the temptation to use them as a usual programming
tool: they can be very slow. Moreover, several of these functions violate some
assumptions about Lua code (e.g., that variables local to a function cannot be
accessed from outside or that userdata metatables cannot be changed by Lua
code) and therefore can compromise otherwise secure code.
All functions in this library are provided inside the debug table. All
functions that operate over a thread have an optional first argument which is
the thread to operate over. The default is always the current thread.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *lua51-debug.debug*
debug.debug () ~

Enters an interactive mode with the user, running each string that the user
enters. Using simple commands and other debug facilities, the user can inspect
global and local variables, change their values, evaluate expressions, and so
on. A line containing only the word cont finishes this function, so that the
caller continues its execution.
Note that commands for debug.debug are not lexically nested within any
function, and so have no direct access to local variables.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                         *lua51-debug.getfenv*
debug.getfenv (o) ~

Returns the environment of object o.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                         *lua51-debug.gethook*
debug.gethook ([thread]) ~

Returns the current hook settings of the thread, as three values: the current
hook function, the current hook mask, and the current hook count (as set by
the |lua51-debug.sethook| function).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                         *lua51-debug.getinfo*
debug.getinfo ([thread,] function [, what]) ~

Returns a table with information about a function. You can give the function
directly, or you can give a number as the value of function, which means the
function running at level function of the call stack of the given thread:
level 0 is the current function (getinfo itself); level 1 is the function that
called getinfo; and so on. If function is a number larger than the number of
active functions, then getinfo returns nil.
The returned table can contain all the fields returned by |lua51-lua_getinfo|,
with the string what describing which fields to fill in. The default for what
is to get all information available, except the table of valid lines. If
present, the option 'f' adds a field named func with the function itself. If
present, the option 'L' adds a field named activelines with the table of valid
lines.
For instance, the expression debug.getinfo(1,"n").name returns a table with a
name for the current function, if a reasonable name can be found, and the
expression debug.getinfo(print) returns a table with all available information
about the |lua51-print| function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                        *lua51-debug.getlocal*
debug.getlocal ([thread,] level, local) ~

This function returns the name and the value of the local variable with index
local of the function at level level of the stack. (The first parameter or
local variable has index 1, and so on, until the last active local variable.)
The function returns nil if there is no local variable with the given index,
and raises an error when called with a level out of range. (You can call
|lua51-debug.getinfo| to check whether the level is valid.)
Variable names starting with '(' (open parentheses) represent internal
variables (loop control variables, temporaries, and C function locals).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                    *lua51-debug.getmetatable*
debug.getmetatable (object) ~

Returns the metatable of the given object or nil if it does not have a
metatable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                     *lua51-debug.getregistry*
debug.getregistry () ~

Returns the registry table (see |lua51-sec3.5|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                      *lua51-debug.getupvalue*
debug.getupvalue (func, up) ~

This function returns the name and the value of the upvalue with index up of
the function func. The function returns nil if there is no upvalue with the
given index.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                         *lua51-debug.setfenv*
debug.setfenv (object, table) ~

Sets the environment of the given object to the given table. Returns object.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                         *lua51-debug.sethook*
debug.sethook ([thread,] hook, mask [, count]) ~

Sets the given function as a hook. The string mask and the number count
describe when the hook will be called. The string mask may have the following
characters, with the given meaning:
- "c": the hook is called every time Lua calls a function;
- "r": the hook is called every time Lua returns from a function;
- "l": the hook is called every time Lua enters a new line of code.
With a count different from zero, the hook is called after every count
instructions.
When called without arguments, |lua51-debug.sethook| turns off the hook.
When the hook is called, its first parameter is a string describing the event
that has triggered its call: "call", "return" (or "tail return", when
simulating a return from a tail call), "line", and "count". For line events,
the hook also gets the new line number as its second parameter. Inside a hook,
you can call getinfo with level 2 to get more information about the running
function (level 0 is the getinfo function, and level 1 is the hook function),
unless the event is "tail return". In this case, Lua is only simulating the
return, and a call to getinfo will return invalid data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                        *lua51-debug.setlocal*
debug.setlocal ([thread,] level, local, value) ~

This function assigns the value value to the local variable with index local
of the function at level level of the stack. The function returns nil if there
is no local variable with the given index, and raises an error when called
with a level out of range. (You can call getinfo to check whether the level is
valid.) Otherwise, it returns the name of the local variable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                    *lua51-debug.setmetatable*
debug.setmetatable (object, table) ~

Sets the metatable for the given object to the given table (which can be nil).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                      *lua51-debug.setupvalue*
debug.setupvalue (func, up, value) ~

This function assigns the value value to the upvalue with index up of the
function func. The function returns nil if there is no upvalue with the given
index. Otherwise, it returns the name of the upvalue.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                       *lua51-debug.traceback*
debug.traceback ([thread,] [message [, level]]) ~

Returns a string with a traceback of the call stack. An optional message
string is appended at the beginning of the traceback. An optional level number
tells at which level to start the traceback (default is 1, the function
calling traceback).

6.  Lua Stand                                                     *lua51-sec6*
==============================================================================
                                                              *lua51-LUA_INIT*

Although Lua has been designed as an extension language, to be embedded in a
host C program, it is also frequently used as a stand-alone language. An
interpreter for Lua as a stand-alone language, called simply lua, is provided
with the standard distribution. The stand-alone interpreter includes all
standard libraries, including the debug library. Its usage is:
>
     lua [options] [script [args]]
<
The options are:
- -e stat: executes string stat;
- -l mod: "requires" mod;
- -i: enters interactive mode after running script;
- -v: prints version information;
- --: stops handling options;
- -: executes stdin as a file and stops handling options.
After handling its options, lua runs the given script, passing to it the given
args as string arguments. When called without arguments, lua behaves as lua -v
-i when the standard input (stdin) is a terminal, and as lua - otherwise.
Before running any argument, the interpreter checks for an environment
variable LUA_INIT. If its format is @filename, then lua executes the file.
Otherwise, lua executes the string itself.
All options are handled in order, except -i. For instance, an invocation like
>
     $ lua -e'a=1' -e 'print(a)' script.lua
<
will first set a to 1, then print the value of a (which is '1'), and finally
run the file script.lua with no arguments. (Here $ is the shell prompt. Your
prompt may be different.)
Before starting to run the script, lua collects all arguments in the command
line in a global table called arg. The script name is stored at index 0, the
first argument after the script name goes to index 1, and so on. Any arguments
before the script name (that is, the interpreter name plus the options) go to
negative indices. For instance, in the call
>
     $ lua -la b.lua t1 t2
<
the interpreter first runs the file a.lua, then creates a table
>
     arg = { [-2] = "lua", [-1] = "-la",
             [0] = "b.lua",
             [1] = "t1", [2] = "t2" }
<
and finally runs the file b.lua. The script is called with arg[1], arg[2], ...
as arguments; it can also access these arguments with the vararg expression
'...'.
In interactive mode, if you write an incomplete statement, the interpreter
waits for its completion by issuing a different prompt.
If the global variable _PROMPT contains a string, then its value is used as
the prompt. Similarly, if the global variable _PROMPT2 contains a string, its
value is used as the secondary prompt (issued during incomplete statements).
Therefore, both prompts can be changed directly on the command line or in any
Lua programs by assigning to _PROMPT. See the next example:
>
     $ lua -e"_PROMPT='myprompt> '" -i
<
(The outer pair of quotes is for the shell, the inner pair is for Lua.) Note
the use of -i to enter interactive mode; otherwise, the program would just end
silently right after the assignment to _PROMPT.
To allow the use of Lua as a script interpreter in Unix systems, the
stand-alone interpreter skips the first line of a chunk if it starts with #.
Therefore, Lua scripts can be made into executable programs by using chmod +x
and the #! form, as in
>
     #!/usr/local/bin/lua
<
(Of course, the location of the Lua interpreter may be different in your
machine. If lua is in your PATH, then
>
     #!/usr/bin/env lua
<
is a more portable solution.)

7.  Incompatibilities with the Previous Version                   *lua51-sec7*
==============================================================================

Here we list the incompatibilities that you may find when moving a program
from Lua 5.0 to Lua 5.1. You can avoid most of the incompatibilities compiling
Lua with appropriate options (see file luaconf.h). However, all these
compatibility options will be removed in the next version of Lua.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.1  Changes in the Language                                    *lua51-sec7.1*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The vararg system changed from the pseudo-argument arg with a table with the
  extra arguments to the vararg expression. (See compile-time option
  LUA_COMPAT_VARARG in luaconf.h.)
- There was a subtle change in the scope of the implicit variables of the for
  statement and for the repeat statement.
- The long string/long comment syntax ([[string]]) does not allow nesting. You
  can use the new syntax ([=[string]=]) in these cases. (See compile-time
  option LUA_COMPAT_LSTR in luaconf.h.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.2  Changes in the Libraries                                   *lua51-sec7.2*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Function string.gfind was renamed |lua51-string.gmatch|. (See compile-time
  option LUA_COMPAT_GFIND in luaconf.h.)
- When |lua51-string.gsub| is called with a function as its third argument,
  whenever this function returns nil or false the replacement string is the
  whole match, instead of the empty string.
- Function table.setn was deprecated. Function table.getn corresponds to the
  new length operator (#); use the operator instead of the function. (See
  compile-time option LUA_COMPAT_GETN in luaconf.h.)
- Function loadlib was renamed |lua51-package.loadlib|. (See compile-time
  option LUA_COMPAT_LOADLIB in luaconf.h.)
- Function math.mod was renamed |lua51-math.fmod|. (See compile-time option
  LUA_COMPAT_MOD in luaconf.h.)
- Functions table.foreach and table.foreachi are deprecated. You can use a for
  loop with pairs or ipairs instead.
- There were substantial changes in function |lua51-require| due to the new
  module system. However, the new behavior is mostly compatible with the old,
  but require gets the path from |lua51-package.path| instead of from
  LUA_PATH.
- Function |lua51-collectgarbage| has different arguments. Function gcinfo is
  deprecated; use collectgarbage("count") instead.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.3  Changes in the API                                         *lua51-sec7.3*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The luaopen_* functions (to open libraries) cannot be called directly, like
  a regular C function. They must be called through Lua, like a Lua function.
- Function lua_open was replaced by |lua51-lua_newstate| to allow the user to
  set a memory-allocation function. You can use |lua51-luaL_newstate| from the
  standard library to create a state with a standard allocation function
  (based on realloc).
- Functions luaL_getn and luaL_setn (from the auxiliary library) are
  deprecated. Use |lua51-lua_objlen| instead of luaL_getn and nothing instead
  of luaL_setn.
- Function luaL_openlib was replaced by |lua51-luaL_register|.
- Function luaL_checkudata now throws an error when the given value is not a
  userdata of the expected type. (In Lua 5.0 it returned NULL.)
