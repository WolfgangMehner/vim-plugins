The Doxygen tool integrates Doxygen. After generating a documentation, the
warnings can be displayed in a quickfix list at any time. The tool assists
with generating Doxygen configuration files and with handling other Doxygen-
related files.

1.  INTRODUCTION                                       *toolbox-doxygen-intro*
==============================================================================

As a first step, the Doxygen configuration file can be set using the ex-
command |:DoxygenConfigFile|: >
  :DoxygenConfigFile ./Doxyfile
This file will now be used, independently of the working directory. Now
Doxygen can be run via |:Doxygen|. Afterwards, the warnings are displayed in a
|quickfix| list. They can be shown later using |:DoxygenWarnings|.

A new configuration file can be generated using |:DoxygenGenerateConfig|. The
user is prompted for a location and name of the new config file. This file is
then generated and its name stored as it would be using |:DoxygenConfigFile|.
The file can be conveniently accessed later via |:DoxygenEditConfig|.

The command |:DoxygenWizard| runs doxywizard. If a configuration file is
already set via |:DoxygenConfigFile|, the wizard is started for that project.

Whenever Doxygen is run, the output is written into log files. The output is
split into the |:DoxygenLogFile| and the |:DoxygenWarningFile|. If the option
'WARN_LOGFILE' is set in the Doxygen config file, the name of the warning file
is automatically recognized. Then the quickfix lists generated by |:Doxygen|
and |:DoxygenWarnings| will read the warnings from this file.

All the configured files can be displayed via |:DoxygenRuntime|, which
provides a short overview of the current state of the tool.

2.  COMMANDS                                        *toolbox-doxygen-commands*
==============================================================================

This chapter provides detailed explanations of all the commands.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                    *:Doxygen*
  :Doxygen [<args>] ~

Runs Doxygen. If called without arguments, uses the config file set via
|:DoxygenConfigFile|. The output produced by Doxygen is written into the log
file (see |:DoxygenViewLog| and |:DoxygenLogFile|) and the warning file (see
|:DoxygenWarnings| and |:DoxygenWarningFile|).
The warnings are then read back from the warning file (see
|:DoxygenWarningFile|) to produce a |quickfix| list. The warnings can also be
viewed later using |:DoxygenWarnings|.
If an warning file is set in the Doxyfile configuration file (option
"WARN_LOGFILE"), it is recognized and used as the warning file.

If the tool is not working properly, prints the reason.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              *:DoxygenWizard*
  :DoxygenWizard [<args>] ~

Runs doxywizard with the given arguments. If called without arguments, the
wizard is started for the config file set via |:DoxygenConfigFile|. If this
file is not readable, just starts the wizard.

If the tool is not working properly, prints the reason.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                          *:DoxygenConfigFile*
  :DoxygenConfigFile [<file>] ~

Sets the Doxygen configuration file. If a specific file has been selected, it
is always used, independent of the current working directory. The directory of
the file is used as the working directory for running Doxygen (see |:Doxygen|).

  :DoxygenConfigFile! ~

Echoes the current configuration file on the command line.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             *:DoxygenLogFile*
  :DoxygenLogFile [<file>] ~

Sets the Doxygen log file. If a specific file has been selected, it is always
used, independent of the current working directory. The file can be viewed by
calling |:DoxygenViewLog|.

  :DoxygenLogFile! ~

Echoes the current log file on the command line.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                         *:DoxygenWarningFile*
  :DoxygenWarningFile [<file>] ~

Sets the Doxygen warning file. If a specific file has been selected, it is
always used, independent of the current working directory. The file is used to
read the warnings for |:DoxygenWarnings|.

  :DoxygenWarningFile! ~

Echoes the current warning file on the command line.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                      *:DoxygenGenerateConfig*
  :DoxygenGenerateConfig ~

The user is asked to pick a location and name for a new config file, which is
then generated automatically. Upon successful completion, the name of the
config file is set as it would be using |:DoxygenConfigFile|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                          *:DoxygenEditConfig*
  :DoxygenEditConfig ~

Opens the configuration file set via |:DoxygenConfigFile| for editing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             *:DoxygenViewLog*
  :DoxygenViewLog ~

Views the log file set via |:DoxygenLogFile|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                            *:DoxygenWarnings*
  :DoxygenWarnings ~

Reads the warnings from the warning file set via |:DoxygenWarningFile| and
generates a |quickfix| list.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                *:DoxygenHelp*
  :DoxygenHelp ~

Opens the help for the Doxygen tool.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             *:DoxygenRuntime*
  :DoxygenRuntime ~

Shows important runtime information:
- the configured files (config, log, warning)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                            *:DoxygenSettings*
  :DoxygenSettings ~
  :DoxygenSettings! ~

Shows the plug-in settings. The second version is verbose.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1  API                                                 *toolbox-doxygen-api*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The various filenames can be set via an API. This allows for setting up the
configuration via a script.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                *mmtoolbox#doxygen#Property()*
The filenames can be set using:

  mmtoolbox#doxygen#Property ( mode, key [, value] ) ~

Parameters:
  mode  - "echo", "get" or "set" (string)
  key   - the name of one of the properties (string)
  value - the new value of the property,
          only with mode "set" (string, optional)
Returns:
  value - the current value of the property,
          only with mode "get" (various)

The property is one of the following:
  "enabled"      - non-zero if the tool is enabled (integer, no "set")
  "config-file"  - the configuration file (string)
  "log-file"     - the log file (string)
  "warning-file" - the warning file (string)

To set the configuration file for a project, use: >
  call mmtoolbox#doxygen#Property ( "set",
      \ "config-file", "$HOME/Projects/MyProject/doc/Doxyfile" )
<
To set the warning file: >
  call mmtoolbox#doxygen#Property ( "set", "warning-file",
      \ "$HOME/Projects/MyProject/doc/doxy_warnings.txt" )
This requires the Doxygen configuration file to include the following line: >
  WARN_LOGFILE = "doxy_warnings.txt"
<
==============================================================================
3.  CONFIGURATION                                     *toolbox-doxygen-config*
==============================================================================

The tool is configured via a number of global variables, which can be set in
the .vimrc file.

  Variable                  Default       Description and further information
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  |g:Doxygen_BinPath|         ''            the path to the binaries (^1)
  |g:Doxygen_Executable|      'doxygen'     the Doxygen executable
  |g:Doxygen_WizardExec|      'doxywizard'  the doxywizard executable
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(^1)
  The Unix defaults are as follows:
  |g:Doxygen_BinPath|         - -empty-
  |g:Doxygen_Executable|      - g:Doxygen_BinPath + doxygen
  |g:Doxygen_WizardExec|      - g:Doxygen_BinPath + doxywizard
  the Windows defaults are as follows:
  |g:Doxygen_BinPath|         - -empty-
  |g:Doxygen_Executable|      - g:Doxygen_BinPath + doxygen.exe
  |g:Doxygen_WizardExec|      - g:Doxygen_BinPath + doxywizard.exe

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                           *g:Doxygen_BinPath*
The path to the executables is set by g:Doxygen_BinPath: >
  let g:Doxygen_BinPath = '/usr/local/bin/'
Since doxygen and doxywizard will be on the path, this will not be necessary
on most UNIX systems.

For Windows, set up the binary path similar to this: >
  let g:Doxygen_BinPath = 'C:\Program Files\doxygen\bin\'
<
The defaults for |g:Doxygen_Executable| and |g:Doxygen_WizardExec| are derived
from g:Doxygen_BinPath. However, the setting g:Doxygen_BinPath is only used to
derive the defaults. If one of the executables is set explicitly, it has to be
set with the whole path.

                                                        *g:Doxygen_Executable*
The executable is set by g:Doxygen_Executable: >
  let g:Doxygen_Executable = 'doxygen'
<
                                                        *g:Doxygen_WizardExec*
The executable of doxywizard is set by g:Doxygen_WizardExec: >
  let g:Doxygen_Executable = 'doxywizard'
<
==============================================================================
4.  TROUBLESHOOTING - KNOWN ISSUES                    *toolbox-doxygen-issues*
==============================================================================

* doxygen or doxywizard are not running.
  - Are they executable from the command line?
  - Is the $PATH variable set correctly?
  - Are the settings correct? See:
      :help |toolbox-doxygen-config|
  - Under Windows, make sure the options 'shell', 'shellcmdflag',
    'shellquote', and 'shellxquote' are set correctly. If "cmd.exe" is used as
    the 'shell', 'shellxquote' must be set to a double quote:
      :set shellxquote=\"
