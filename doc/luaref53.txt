1.  Introduction                                                  *lua53-sec1*
==============================================================================

Lua is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. It
supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional
programming, data-driven programming, and data description.
Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description
constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is
dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode with a register-based virtual
machine, and has automatic memory management with incremental garbage
collection, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid
prototyping.
Lua is implemented as a library, written in clean C, the common subset of
Standard C and C++. The Lua distribution includes a host program called lua,
which uses the Lua library to offer a complete, standalone Lua interpreter,
for interactive or batch use. Lua is intended to be used both as a powerful,
lightweight, embeddable scripting language for any program that needs one, and
as a powerful but lightweight and efficient stand-alone language.
As an extension language, Lua has no notion of a "main" program: it works
embedded in a host client, called the embedding program or simply the host.
(Frequently, this host is the stand-alone lua program.) The host program can
invoke functions to execute a piece of Lua code, can write and read Lua
variables, and can register C functions to be called by Lua code. Through the
use of C functions, Lua can be augmented to cope with a wide range of
different domains, thus creating customized programming languages sharing a
syntactical framework.
Lua is free software, and is provided as usual with no guarantees, as stated
in its license. The implementation described in this manual is available at
Lua's official web site, www.lua.org.
Like any other reference manual, this document is dry in places. For a
discussion of the decisions behind the design of Lua, see the technical papers
available at Lua's web site. For a detailed introduction to programming in
Lua, see Roberto's book, Programming in Lua.

2.  Basic Concepts                                                *lua53-sec2*
==============================================================================

This section describes the basic concepts of the language.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1  Values and Types                                           *lua53-sec2.1*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua is a dynamically typed language. This means that variables do not have
types; only values do. There are no type definitions in the language. All
values carry their own type.
All values in Lua are first-class values. This means that all values can be
stored in variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as
results.
There are eight basic types in Lua: nil, boolean, number, string, function,
userdata, thread, and table. The type nil has one single value, nil, whose
main property is to be different from any other value; it usually represents
the absence of a useful value. The type boolean has two values, false and
true. Both nil and false make a condition false; any other value makes it
true. The type number represents both integer numbers and real
(floating-point) numbers. The type string represents immutable sequences of
bytes. Lua is 8-bit clean: strings can contain any 8-bit value, including
embedded zeros ('\0'). Lua is also encoding-agnostic; it makes no assumptions
about the contents of a string.
The type number uses two internal representations, or two subtypes, one called
integer and the other called float. Lua has explicit rules about when each
representation is used, but it also converts between them automatically as
needed (see |lua53-sec3.4.3|). Therefore, the programmer may choose to mostly
ignore the difference between integers and floats or to assume complete
control over the representation of each number. Standard Lua uses 64-bit
integers and double-precision (64-bit) floats, but you can also compile Lua so
that it uses 32-bit integers and/or single-precision (32-bit) floats. The
option with 32 bits for both integers and floats is particularly attractive
for small machines and embedded systems. (See macro LUA_32BITS in file
luaconf.h.)
Lua can call (and manipulate) functions written in Lua and functions written
in C (see |lua53-sec3.4.10|). Both are represented by the type function.
The type userdata is provided to allow arbitrary C data to be stored in Lua
variables. A userdata value represents a block of raw memory. There are two
kinds of userdata: full userdata, which is an object with a block of memory
managed by Lua, and light userdata, which is simply a C pointer value.
Userdata has no predefined operations in Lua, except assignment and identity
test. By using metatables, the programmer can define operations for full
userdata values (see |lua53-sec2.4|). Userdata values cannot be created or
modified in Lua, only through the C API. This guarantees the integrity of data
owned by the host program.
The type thread represents independent threads of execution and it is used to
implement coroutines (see |lua53-sec2.6|). Lua threads are not related to
operating-system threads. Lua supports coroutines on all systems, even those
that do not support threads natively.
The type table implements associative arrays, that is, arrays that can be
indexed not only with numbers, but with any Lua value except nil and NaN. (Not
a Number is a special value used to represent undefined or unrepresentable
numerical results, such as 0/0.) Tables can be heterogeneous; that is, they
can contain values of all types (except nil). Any key with value nil is not
considered part of the table. Conversely, any key that is not part of a table
has an associated value nil.
Tables are the sole data-structuring mechanism in Lua; they can be used to
represent ordinary arrays, lists, symbol tables, sets, records, graphs, trees,
etc. To represent records, Lua uses the field name as an index. The language
supports this representation by providing a.name as syntactic sugar for
a["name"]. There are several convenient ways to create tables in Lua (see
|lua53-sec3.4.9|).
Like indices, the values of table fields can be of any type. In particular,
because functions are first-class values, table fields can contain functions.
Thus tables can also carry methods (see |lua53-sec3.4.11|).
The indexing of tables follows the definition of raw equality in the language.
The expressions a[i] and a[j] denote the same table element if and only if i
and j are raw equal (that is, equal without metamethods). In particular,
floats with integral values are equal to their respective integers (e.g., 1.0
== 1). To avoid ambiguities, any float with integral value used as a key is
converted to its respective integer. For instance, if you write a[2.0] = true,
the actual key inserted into the table will be the integer 2. (On the other
hand, 2 and "2" are different Lua values and therefore denote different table
entries.)
Tables, functions, threads, and (full) userdata values are objects: variables
do not actually contain these values, only references to them. Assignment,
parameter passing, and function returns always manipulate references to such
values; these operations do not imply any kind of copy.
The library function |lua53-type| returns a string describing the type of a
given value (see |lua53-sec6.1|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2  Environments and the Global Environment                    *lua53-sec2.2*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As will be discussed in |lua53-sec3.2| and |lua53-sec3.3.3|, any reference to
a free name (that is, a name not bound to any declaration) var is
syntactically translated to _ENV.var. Moreover, every chunk is compiled in the
scope of an external local variable named _ENV (see |lua53-sec3.3.2|), so _ENV
itself is never a free name in a chunk.
Despite the existence of this external _ENV variable and the translation of
free names, _ENV is a completely regular name. In particular, you can define
new variables and parameters with that name. Each reference to a free name
uses the _ENV that is visible at that point in the program, following the
usual visibility rules of Lua (see |lua53-sec3.5|).
Any table used as the value of _ENV is called an environment.
Lua keeps a distinguished environment called the global environment. This
value is kept at a special index in the C registry (see |lua53-sec4.5|). In
Lua, the global variable |lua53-_G| is initialized with this same value.
(|lua53-_G| is never used internally.)
When Lua loads a chunk, the default value for its _ENV upvalue is the global
environment (see |lua53-load|). Therefore, by default, free names in Lua code
refer to entries in the global environment (and, therefore, they are also
called global variables). Moreover, all standard libraries are loaded in the
global environment and some functions there operate on that environment. You
can use |lua53-load| (or |lua53-loadfile|) to load a chunk with a different
environment. (In C, you have to load the chunk and then change the value of
its first upvalue.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3  Error Handling                                             *lua53-sec2.3*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because Lua is an embedded extension language, all Lua actions start from C
code in the host program calling a function from the Lua library. (When you
use Lua standalone, the lua application is the host program.) Whenever an
error occurs during the compilation or execution of a Lua chunk, control
returns to the host, which can take appropriate measures (such as printing an
error message).
Lua code can explicitly generate an error by calling the |lua53-error|
function. If you need to catch errors in Lua, you can use |lua53-pcall| or
|lua53-xpcall| to call a given function in protected mode.
Whenever there is an error, an error object (also called an error message) is
propagated with information about the error. Lua itself only generates errors
whose error object is a string, but programs may generate errors with any
value as the error object. It is up to the Lua program or its host to handle
such error objects.
When you use |lua53-xpcall| or |lua53-lua_pcall|, you may give a message
handler to be called in case of errors. This function is called with the
original error object and returns a new error object. It is called before the
error unwinds the stack, so that it can gather more information about the
error, for instance by inspecting the stack and creating a stack traceback.
This message handler is still protected by the protected call; so, an error
inside the message handler will call the message handler again. If this loop
goes on for too long, Lua breaks it and returns an appropriate message. (The
message handler is called only for regular runtime errors. It is not called
for memory-allocation errors nor for errors while running finalizers.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.4  Metatables and Metamethods                                 *lua53-sec2.4*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every value in Lua can have a metatable. This metatable is an ordinary Lua
table that defines the behavior of the original value under certain special
operations. You can change several aspects of the behavior of operations over
a value by setting specific fields in its metatable. For instance, when a
non-numeric value is the operand of an addition, Lua checks for a function in
the field "__add" of the value's metatable. If it finds one, Lua calls this
function to perform the addition.
The key for each event in a metatable is a string with the event name prefixed
by two underscores; the corresponding values are called metamethods. In the
previous example, the key is "__add" and the metamethod is the function that
performs the addition.
You can query the metatable of any value using the |lua53-getmetatable|
function. Lua queries metamethods in metatables using a raw access (see
|lua53-rawget|). So, to retrieve the metamethod for event ev in object o, Lua
does the equivalent to the following code:
>
     rawget(getmetatable(o) or {}, "__ev")
<
You can replace the metatable of tables using the |lua53-setmetatable|
function. You cannot change the metatable of other types from Lua code (except
by using the debug library (|lua53-sec6.10|)); you should use the C API for
that.
Tables and full userdata have individual metatables (although multiple tables
and userdata can share their metatables). Values of all other types share one
single metatable per type; that is, there is one single metatable for all
numbers, one for all strings, etc. By default, a value has no metatable, but
the string library sets a metatable for the string type (see |lua53-sec6.4|).
A metatable controls how an object behaves in arithmetic operations, bitwise
operations, order comparisons, concatenation, length operation, calls, and
indexing. A metatable also can define a function to be called when a userdata
or a table is garbage collected (|lua53-sec2.5|).
For the unary operators (negation, length, and bitwise NOT), the metamethod is
computed and called with a dummy second operand, equal to the first one. This
extra operand is only to simplify Lua's internals (by making these operators
behave like a binary operation) and may be removed in future versions. (For
most uses this extra operand is irrelevant.)
A detailed list of events controlled by metatables is given next. Each
operation is identified by its corresponding key.
- __add: the addition (+) operation. If any operand for an addition is not a
  number (nor a string coercible to a number), Lua will try to call a
  metamethod. First, Lua will check the first operand (even if it is valid).
  If that operand does not define a metamethod for __add, then Lua will check
  the second operand. If Lua can find a metamethod, it calls the metamethod
  with the two operands as arguments, and the result of the call (adjusted to
  one value) is the result of the operation. Otherwise, it raises an error.
- __sub: the subtraction (-) operation. Behavior similar to the addition
  operation.
- __mul: the multiplication (*) operation. Behavior similar to the addition
  operation.
- __div: the division (/) operation. Behavior similar to the addition
  operation.
- __mod: the modulo (%) operation. Behavior similar to the addition operation.
- __pow: the exponentiation (^) operation. Behavior similar to the addition
  operation.
- __unm: the negation (unary -) operation. Behavior similar to the addition
  operation.
- __idiv: the floor division (//) operation. Behavior similar to the addition
  operation.
- __band: the bitwise AND (&) operation. Behavior similar to the addition
  operation, except that Lua will try a metamethod if any operand is neither
  an integer nor a value coercible to an integer (see |lua53-sec3.4.3|).
- __bor: the bitwise OR (|) operation. Behavior similar to the bitwise AND
  operation.
- __bxor: the bitwise exclusive OR (binary ~) operation. Behavior similar to
  the bitwise AND operation.
- __bnot: the bitwise NOT (unary ~) operation. Behavior similar to the bitwise
  AND operation.
- __shl: the bitwise left shift (<<) operation. Behavior similar to the
  bitwise AND operation.
- __shr: the bitwise right shift (>>) operation. Behavior similar to the
  bitwise AND operation.
- __concat: the concatenation (..) operation. Behavior similar to the addition
  operation, except that Lua will try a metamethod if any operand is neither a
  string nor a number (which is always coercible to a string).
- __len: the length (#) operation. If the object is not a string, Lua will try
  its metamethod. If there is a metamethod, Lua calls it with the object as
  argument, and the result of the call (always adjusted to one value) is the
  result of the operation. If there is no metamethod but the object is a
  table, then Lua uses the table length operation (see |lua53-sec3.4.7|).
  Otherwise, Lua raises an error.
- __eq: the equal (==) operation. Behavior similar to the addition operation,
  except that Lua will try a metamethod only when the values being compared
  are either both tables or both full userdata and they are not primitively
  equal. The result of the call is always converted to a boolean.
- __lt: the less than (<) operation. Behavior similar to the addition
  operation, except that Lua will try a metamethod only when the values being
  compared are neither both numbers nor both strings. The result of the call
  is always converted to a boolean.
- __le: the less equal (<=) operation. Unlike other operations, the less-equal
  operation can use two different events. First, Lua looks for the __le
  metamethod in both operands, like in the less than operation. If it cannot
  find such a metamethod, then it will try the __lt metamethod, assuming that
  a <= b is equivalent to not (b < a). As with the other comparison operators,
  the result is always a boolean. (This use of the __lt event can be removed
  in future versions; it is also slower than a real __le metamethod.)
- __index: The indexing access table[key]. This event happens when table is
  not a table or when key is not present in table. The metamethod is looked up
  in table.
  Despite the name, the metamethod for this event can be either a function or
  a table. If it is a function, it is called with table and key as arguments,
  and the result of the call (adjusted to one value) is the result of the
  operation. If it is a table, the final result is the result of indexing this
  table with key. (This indexing is regular, not raw, and therefore can
  trigger another metamethod.)
- __newindex: The indexing assignment table[key] = value. Like the index
  event, this event happens when table is not a table or when key is not
  present in table. The metamethod is looked up in table.
  Like with indexing, the metamethod for this event can be either a function
  or a table. If it is a function, it is called with table, key, and value as
  arguments. If it is a table, Lua does an indexing assignment to this table
  with the same key and value. (This assignment is regular, not raw, and
  therefore can trigger another metamethod.)
  Whenever there is a __newindex metamethod, Lua does not perform the
  primitive assignment. (If necessary, the metamethod itself can call
  |lua53-rawset| to do the assignment.)
- __call: The call operation func(args). This event happens when Lua tries to
  call a non-function value (that is, func is not a function). The metamethod
  is looked up in func. If present, the metamethod is called with func as its
  first argument, followed by the arguments of the original call (args). All
  results of the call are the result of the operation. (This is the only
  metamethod that allows multiple results.)
It is a good practice to add all needed metamethods to a table before setting
it as a metatable of some object. In particular, the __gc metamethod works
only when this order is followed (see |lua53-sec2.5.1|).
Because metatables are regular tables, they can contain arbitrary fields, not
only the event names defined above. Some functions in the standard library
(e.g., |lua53-tostring|) use other fields in metatables for their own
purposes.

2.5  Garbage Collection                                         *lua53-sec2.5*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua performs automatic memory management. This means that you do not have to
worry about allocating memory for new objects or freeing it when the objects
are no longer needed. Lua manages memory automatically by running a garbage
collector to collect all dead objects (that is, objects that are no longer
accessible from Lua). All memory used by Lua is subject to automatic
management: strings, tables, userdata, functions, threads, internal
structures, etc.
Lua implements an incremental mark-and-sweep collector. It uses two numbers to
control its garbage-collection cycles: the garbage-collector pause and the
garbage-collector step multiplier. Both use percentage points as units (e.g.,
a value of 100 means an internal value of 1).
The garbage-collector pause controls how long the collector waits before
starting a new cycle. Larger values make the collector less aggressive. Values
smaller than 100 mean the collector will not wait to start a new cycle. A
value of 200 means that the collector waits for the total memory in use to
double before starting a new cycle.
The garbage-collector step multiplier controls the relative speed of the
collector relative to memory allocation. Larger values make the collector more
aggressive but also increase the size of each incremental step. You should not
use values smaller than 100, because they make the collector too slow and can
result in the collector never finishing a cycle. The default is 200, which
means that the collector runs at "twice" the speed of memory allocation.
If you set the step multiplier to a very large number (larger than 10% of the
maximum number of bytes that the program may use), the collector behaves like
a stop-the-world collector. If you then set the pause to 200, the collector
behaves as in old Lua versions, doing a complete collection every time Lua
doubles its memory usage.
You can change these numbers by calling |lua53-lua_gc| in C or
|lua53-collectgarbage| in Lua. You can also use these functions to control the
collector directly (e.g., stop and restart it).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.5.1  Garbage                                                *lua53-sec2.5.1*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can set garbage-collector metamethods for tables and, using the C API, for
full userdata (see |lua53-sec2.4|). These metamethods are also called
finalizers. Finalizers allow you to coordinate Lua's garbage collection with
external resource management (such as closing files, network or database
connections, or freeing your own memory).
For an object (table or userdata) to be finalized when collected, you must
mark it for finalization. You mark an object for finalization when you set its
metatable and the metatable has a field indexed by the string "__gc". Note
that if you set a metatable without a __gc field and later create that field
in the metatable, the object will not be marked for finalization.
When a marked object becomes garbage, it is not collected immediately by the
garbage collector. Instead, Lua puts it in a list. After the collection, Lua
goes through that list. For each object in the list, it checks the object's
__gc metamethod: If it is a function, Lua calls it with the object as its
single argument; if the metamethod is not a function, Lua simply ignores it.
At the end of each garbage-collection cycle, the finalizers for objects are
called in the reverse order that the objects were marked for finalization,
among those collected in that cycle; that is, the first finalizer to be called
is the one associated with the object marked last in the program. The
execution of each finalizer may occur at any point during the execution of the
regular code.
Because the object being collected must still be used by the finalizer, that
object (and other objects accessible only through it) must be resurrected by
Lua. Usually, this resurrection is transient, and the object memory is freed
in the next garbage-collection cycle. However, if the finalizer stores the
object in some global place (e.g., a global variable), then the resurrection
is permanent. Moreover, if the finalizer marks a finalizing object for
finalization again, its finalizer will be called again in the next cycle where
the object is unreachable. In any case, the object memory is freed only in a
GC cycle where the object is unreachable and not marked for finalization.
When you close a state (see |lua53-lua_close|), Lua calls the finalizers of
all objects marked for finalization, following the reverse order that they
were marked. If any finalizer marks objects for collection during that phase,
these marks have no effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.5.2  Weak Tables                                            *lua53-sec2.5.2*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A weak table is a table whose elements are weak references. A weak reference
is ignored by the garbage collector. In other words, if the only references to
an object are weak references, then the garbage collector will collect that
object.
A weak table can have weak keys, weak values, or both. A table with weak
values allows the collection of its values, but prevents the collection of its
keys. A table with both weak keys and weak values allows the collection of
both keys and values. In any case, if either the key or the value is
collected, the whole pair is removed from the table. The weakness of a table
is controlled by the __mode field of its metatable. If the __mode field is a
string containing the character 'k', the keys in the table are weak. If __mode
contains 'v', the values in the table are weak.
A table with weak keys and strong values is also called an ephemeron table. In
an ephemeron table, a value is considered reachable only if its key is
reachable. In particular, if the only reference to a key comes through its
value, the pair is removed.
Any change in the weakness of a table may take effect only at the next collect
cycle. In particular, if you change the weakness to a stronger mode, Lua may
still collect some items from that table before the change takes effect.
Only objects that have an explicit construction are removed from weak tables.
Values, such as numbers and light C functions, are not subject to garbage
collection, and therefore are not removed from weak tables (unless their
associated values are collected). Although strings are subject to garbage
collection, they do not have an explicit construction, and therefore are not
removed from weak tables.
Resurrected objects (that is, objects being finalized and objects accessible
only through objects being finalized) have a special behavior in weak tables.
They are removed from weak values before running their finalizers, but are
removed from weak keys only in the next collection after running their
finalizers, when such objects are actually freed. This behavior allows the
finalizer to access properties associated with the object through weak tables.
If a weak table is among the resurrected objects in a collection cycle, it may
not be properly cleared until the next cycle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.6  Coroutines                                                 *lua53-sec2.6*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua supports coroutines, also called collaborative multithreading. A coroutine
in Lua represents an independent thread of execution. Unlike threads in
multithread systems, however, a coroutine only suspends its execution by
explicitly calling a yield function.
You create a coroutine by calling |lua53-coroutine.create|. Its sole argument
is a function that is the main function of the coroutine. The create function
only creates a new coroutine and returns a handle to it (an object of type
thread); it does not start the coroutine.
You execute a coroutine by calling |lua53-coroutine.resume|. When you first
call |lua53-coroutine.resume|, passing as its first argument a thread returned
by |lua53-coroutine.create|, the coroutine starts its execution by calling its
main function. Extra arguments passed to |lua53-coroutine.resume| are passed
as arguments to that function. After the coroutine starts running, it runs
until it terminates or yields.
A coroutine can terminate its execution in two ways: normally, when its main
function returns (explicitly or implicitly, after the last instruction); and
abnormally, if there is an unprotected error. In case of normal termination,
|lua53-coroutine.resume| returns true, plus any values returned by the
coroutine main function. In case of errors, |lua53-coroutine.resume| returns
false plus an error object.
A coroutine yields by calling |lua53-coroutine.yield|. When a coroutine
yields, the corresponding |lua53-coroutine.resume| returns immediately, even
if the yield happens inside nested function calls (that is, not in the main
function, but in a function directly or indirectly called by the main
function). In the case of a yield, |lua53-coroutine.resume| also returns true,
plus any values passed to |lua53-coroutine.yield|. The next time you resume
the same coroutine, it continues its execution from the point where it
yielded, with the call to |lua53-coroutine.yield| returning any extra
arguments passed to |lua53-coroutine.resume|.
Like |lua53-coroutine.create|, the |lua53-coroutine.wrap| function also
creates a coroutine, but instead of returning the coroutine itself, it returns
a function that, when called, resumes the coroutine. Any arguments passed to
this function go as extra arguments to |lua53-coroutine.resume|.
|lua53-coroutine.wrap| returns all the values returned by
|lua53-coroutine.resume|, except the first one (the boolean error code).
Unlike |lua53-coroutine.resume|, |lua53-coroutine.wrap| does not catch errors;
any error is propagated to the caller.
As an example of how coroutines work, consider the following code:
>
     function foo (a)
       print("foo", a)
       return coroutine.yield(2*a)
     end
     
     co = coroutine.create(function (a,b)
           print("co-body", a, b)
           local r = foo(a+1)
           print("co-body", r)
           local r, s = coroutine.yield(a+b, a-b)
           print("co-body", r, s)
           return b, "end"
     end)
     
     print("main", coroutine.resume(co, 1, 10))
     print("main", coroutine.resume(co, "r"))
     print("main", coroutine.resume(co, "x", "y"))
     print("main", coroutine.resume(co, "x", "y"))
<
When you run it, it produces the following output:
>
     co-body 1       10
     foo     2
     main    true    4
     co-body r
     main    true    11      -9
     co-body x       y
     main    true    10      end
     main    false   cannot resume dead coroutine
<
You can also create and manipulate coroutines through the C API: see functions
|lua53-lua_newthread|, |lua53-lua_resume|, and |lua53-lua_yield|.

==============================================================================
3.  The Language                                                  *lua53-sec3*
==============================================================================

This section describes the lexis, the syntax, and the semantics of Lua. In
other words, this section describes which tokens are valid, how they can be
combined, and what their combinations mean.
Language constructs will be explained using the usual extended BNF notation,
in which {a} means 0 or more a's, and [a] means an optional a. Non-terminals
are shown like non-terminal, keywords are shown like kword, and other terminal
symbols are shown like '='. The complete syntax of Lua can be found in
|lua53-sec9| at the end of this manual.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1  Lexical Conventions                                        *lua53-sec3.1*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua is a free-form language. It ignores spaces (including new lines) and
comments between lexical elements (tokens), except as delimiters between names
and keywords.
Names (also called identifiers) in Lua can be any string of letters, digits,
and underscores, not beginning with a digit and not being a reserved word.
Identifiers are used to name variables, table fields, and labels.
The following keywords are reserved and cannot be used as names:
>
     and       break     do        else      elseif    end
     false     for       function  goto      if        in
     local     nil       not       or        repeat    return
     then      true      until     while
<
Lua is a case-sensitive language: and is a reserved word, but And and AND are
two different, valid names. As a convention, programs should avoid creating
names that start with an underscore followed by one or more uppercase letters
(such as |lua53-_VERSION|).
The following strings denote other tokens:
>
     +     -     *     /     %     ^     #
     &     ~     |     <<    >>    //
     ==    ~=    <=    >=    <     >     =
     (     )     {     }     [     ]     ::
     ;     :     ,     .     ..    ...
<
A short literal string can be delimited by matching single or double quotes,
and can contain the following C-like escape sequences: '\a' (bell), '\b'
(backspace), '\f' (form feed), '\n' (newline), '\r' (carriage return), '\t'
(horizontal tab), '\v' (vertical tab), '\\' (backslash), '\"' (quotation mark
[double quote]), and '\'' (apostrophe [single quote]). A backslash followed by
a line break results in a newline in the string. The escape sequence '\z'
skips the following span of white-space characters, including line breaks; it
is particularly useful to break and indent a long literal string into multiple
lines without adding the newlines and spaces into the string contents. A short
literal string cannot contain unescaped line breaks nor escapes not forming a
valid escape sequence.
We can specify any byte in a short literal string by its numeric value
(including embedded zeros). This can be done with the escape sequence \xXX,
where XX is a sequence of exactly two hexadecimal digits, or with the escape
sequence \ddd, where ddd is a sequence of up to three decimal digits. (Note
that if a decimal escape sequence is to be followed by a digit, it must be
expressed using exactly three digits.)
The UTF-8 encoding of a Unicode character can be inserted in a literal string
with the escape sequence \u{XXX} (note the mandatory enclosing brackets),
where XXX is a sequence of one or more hexadecimal digits representing the
character code point.
Literal strings can also be defined using a long format enclosed by long
brackets. We define an opening long bracket of level n as an opening square
bracket followed by n equal signs followed by another opening square bracket.
So, an opening long bracket of level 0 is written as [[, an opening long
bracket of level 1 is written as [=[, and so on. A closing long bracket is
defined similarly; for instance, a closing long bracket of level 4 is written
as ]====]. A long literal starts with an opening long bracket of any level and
ends at the first closing long bracket of the same level. It can contain any
text except a closing bracket of the same level. Literals in this bracketed
form can run for several lines, do not interpret any escape sequences, and
ignore long brackets of any other level. Any kind of end-of-line sequence
(carriage return, newline, carriage return followed by newline, or newline
followed by carriage return) is converted to a simple newline.
For convenience, when the opening long bracket is immediately followed by a
newline, the newline is not included in the string. As an example, in a system
using ASCII (in which 'a' is coded as 97, newline is coded as 10, and '1' is
coded as 49), the five literal strings below denote the same string:
>
     a = 'alo\n123"'
     a = "alo\n123\""
     a = '\97lo\10\04923"'
     a = [[alo
     123"]]
     a = [==[
     alo
     123"]==]
<
Any byte in a literal string not explicitly affected by the previous rules
represents itself. However, Lua opens files for parsing in text mode, and the
system file functions may have problems with some control characters. So, it
is safer to represent non-text data as a quoted literal with explicit escape
sequences for the non-text characters.
A numeric constant (or numeral) can be written with an optional fractional
part and an optional decimal exponent, marked by a letter 'e' or 'E'. Lua also
accepts hexadecimal constants, which start with 0x or 0X. Hexadecimal
constants also accept an optional fractional part plus an optional binary
exponent, marked by a letter 'p' or 'P'. A numeric constant with a radix point
or an exponent denotes a float; otherwise, if its value fits in an integer, it
denotes an integer. Examples of valid integer constants are
>
     3   345   0xff   0xBEBADA
<
Examples of valid float constants are
>
     3.0     3.1416     314.16e-2     0.31416E1     34e1
     0x0.1E  0xA23p-4   0X1.921FB54442D18P+1
<
A comment starts with a double hyphen (--) anywhere outside a string. If the
text immediately after -- is not an opening long bracket, the comment is a
short comment, which runs until the end of the line. Otherwise, it is a long
comment, which runs until the corresponding closing long bracket. Long
comments are frequently used to disable code temporarily.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2  Variables                                                  *lua53-sec3.2*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Variables are places that store values. There are three kinds of variables in
Lua: global variables, local variables, and table fields.
A single name can denote a global variable or a local variable (or a
function's formal parameter, which is a particular kind of local variable):
>
	var ::= Name
<
Name denotes identifiers, as defined in |lua53-sec3.1|.
Any variable name is assumed to be global unless explicitly declared as a
local (see |lua53-sec3.3.7|). Local variables are lexically scoped: local
variables can be freely accessed by functions defined inside their scope (see
|lua53-sec3.5|).
Before the first assignment to a variable, its value is nil.
Square brackets are used to index a table:
>
	var ::= prefixexp '[' exp ']'
<
The meaning of accesses to table fields can be changed via metatables. An
access to an indexed variable t[i] is equivalent to a call
gettable_event(t,i). (See |lua53-sec2.4| for a complete description of the
gettable_event function. This function is not defined or callable in Lua. We
use it here only for explanatory purposes.)
The syntax var.Name is just syntactic sugar for var["Name"]:
>
	var ::= prefixexp '.' Name
<
An access to a global variable x is equivalent to _ENV.x. Due to the way that
chunks are compiled, _ENV is never a global name (see |lua53-sec2.2|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3  Statements                                                 *lua53-sec3.3*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua supports an almost conventional set of statements, similar to those in
Pascal or C. This set includes assignments, control structures, function
calls, and variable declarations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3.1  Blocks                                                 *lua53-sec3.3.1*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A block is a list of statements, which are executed sequentially:
>
	block ::= {stat}
<
Lua has empty statements that allow you to separate statements with
semicolons, start a block with a semicolon or write two semicolons in
sequence:
>
	stat ::= ';'
<
Function calls and assignments can start with an open parenthesis. This
possibility leads to an ambiguity in Lua's grammar. Consider the following
fragment:
>
     a = b + c
     (print or io.write)('done')
<
The grammar could see it in two ways:
>
     a = b + c(print or io.write)('done')
     
     a = b + c; (print or io.write)('done')
<
The current parser always sees such constructions in the first way,
interpreting the open parenthesis as the start of the arguments to a call. To
avoid this ambiguity, it is a good practice to always precede with a semicolon
statements that start with a parenthesis:
>
     ;(print or io.write)('done')
<
A block can be explicitly delimited to produce a single statement:
>
	stat ::= do block end
<
Explicit blocks are useful to control the scope of variable declarations.
Explicit blocks are also sometimes used to add a return statement in the
middle of another block (see |lua53-sec3.3.4|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3.2  Chunks                                                 *lua53-sec3.3.2*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The unit of compilation of Lua is called a chunk. Syntactically, a chunk is
simply a block:
>
	chunk ::= block
<
Lua handles a chunk as the body of an anonymous function with a variable
number of arguments (see |lua53-sec3.4.11|). As such, chunks can define local
variables, receive arguments, and return values. Moreover, such anonymous
function is compiled as in the scope of an external local variable called _ENV
(see |lua53-sec2.2|). The resulting function always has _ENV as its only
upvalue, even if it does not use that variable.
A chunk can be stored in a file or in a string inside the host program. To
execute a chunk, Lua first loads it, precompiling the chunk's code into
instructions for a virtual machine, and then Lua executes the compiled code
with an interpreter for the virtual machine.
Chunks can also be precompiled into binary form; see program luac and function
|lua53-string.dump| for details. Programs in source and compiled forms are
interchangeable; Lua automatically detects the file type and acts accordingly
(see |lua53-load|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3.3  Assignment                                             *lua53-sec3.3.3*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua allows multiple assignments. Therefore, the syntax for assignment defines
a list of variables on the left side and a list of expressions on the right
side. The elements in both lists are separated by commas:
>
	stat ::= varlist '=' explist
	varlist ::= var {',' var}
	explist ::= exp {',' exp}
<
Expressions are discussed in |lua53-sec3.4|.
Before the assignment, the list of values is adjusted to the length of the
list of variables. If there are more values than needed, the excess values are
thrown away. If there are fewer values than needed, the list is extended with
as many nil's as needed. If the list of expressions ends with a function call,
then all values returned by that call enter the list of values, before the
adjustment (except when the call is enclosed in parentheses; see
|lua53-sec3.4|).
The assignment statement first evaluates all its expressions and only then the
assignments are performed. Thus the code
>
     i = 3
     i, a[i] = i+1, 20
<
sets a[3] to 20, without affecting a[4] because the i in a[i] is evaluated (to
3) before it is assigned 4. Similarly, the line
>
     x, y = y, x
<
exchanges the values of x and y, and
>
     x, y, z = y, z, x
<
cyclically permutes the values of x, y, and z.
The meaning of assignments to global variables and table fields can be changed
via metatables. An assignment to an indexed variable t[i] = val is equivalent
to settable_event(t,i,val). (See |lua53-sec2.4| for a complete description of
the settable_event function. This function is not defined or callable in Lua.
We use it here only for explanatory purposes.)
An assignment to a global name x = val is equivalent to the assignment _ENV.x
= val (see |lua53-sec2.2|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3.4  Control Structures                                     *lua53-sec3.3.4*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The control structures if, while, and repeat have the usual meaning and
familiar syntax:
>
	stat ::= while exp do block end
	stat ::= repeat block until exp
	stat ::= if exp then block {elseif exp then block} [else block] end
<
Lua also has a for statement, in two flavors (see |lua53-sec3.3.5|).
The condition expression of a control structure can return any value. Both
false and nil are considered false. All values different from nil and false
are considered true (in particular, the number 0 and the empty string are also
true).
In the repeat-until loop, the inner block does not end at the until keyword,
but only after the condition. So, the condition can refer to local variables
declared inside the loop block.
The goto statement transfers the program control to a label. For syntactical
reasons, labels in Lua are considered statements too:
>
	stat ::= goto Name
	stat ::= label
	label ::= '::' Name '::'
<
A label is visible in the entire block where it is defined, except inside
nested blocks where a label with the same name is defined and inside nested
functions. A goto may jump to any visible label as long as it does not enter
into the scope of a local variable.
Labels and empty statements are called void statements, as they perform no
actions.
The break statement terminates the execution of a while, repeat, or for loop,
skipping to the next statement after the loop:
>
	stat ::= break
<
A break ends the innermost enclosing loop.
The return statement is used to return values from a function or a chunk
(which is an anonymous function). Functions can return more than one value, so
the syntax for the return statement is
>
	stat ::= return [explist] [';']
<
The return statement can only be written as the last statement of a block. If
it is really necessary to return in the middle of a block, then an explicit
inner block can be used, as in the idiom do return end, because now return is
the last statement in its (inner) block.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3.5  For Statement                                          *lua53-sec3.3.5*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The for statement has two forms: one numerical and one generic.
The numerical for loop repeats a block of code while a control variable runs
through an arithmetic progression. It has the following syntax:
>
	stat ::= for Name '=' exp ',' exp [',' exp] do block end
<
The block is repeated for name starting at the value of the first exp, until
it passes the second exp by steps of the third exp. More precisely, a for
statement like
>
     for v = e1, e2, e3 do block end
<
is equivalent to the code:
>
     do
       local var, limit, step = tonumber(e1), tonumber(e2), tonumber(e3)
       if not (var and limit and step) then error() end
       var = var - step
       while true do
         var = var + step
         if (step >= 0 and var > limit) or (step < 0 and var < limit) then
           break
         end
         local v = var
         block
       end
     end
<
Note the following:
- All three control expressions are evaluated only once, before the loop
  starts. They must all result in numbers.
- var, limit, and step are invisible variables. The names shown here are for
  explanatory purposes only.
- If the third expression (the step) is absent, then a step of 1 is used.
- You can use break and goto to exit a for loop.
- The loop variable v is local to the loop body. If you need its value after
  the loop, assign it to another variable before exiting the loop.
The generic for statement works over functions, called iterators. On each
iteration, the iterator function is called to produce a new value, stopping
when this new value is nil. The generic for loop has the following syntax:
>
	stat ::= for namelist in explist do block end
	namelist ::= Name {',' Name}
<
A for statement like
>
     for var_1, ..., var_n in explist do block end
<
is equivalent to the code:
>
     do
       local f, s, var = explist
       while true do
         local var_1, ..., var_n = f(s, var)
         if var_1 == nil then break end
         var = var_1
         block
       end
     end
<
Note the following:
- explist is evaluated only once. Its results are an iterator function, a
  state, and an initial value for the first iterator variable.
- f, s, and var are invisible variables. The names are here for explanatory
  purposes only.
- You can use break to exit a for loop.
- The loop variables var_i are local to the loop; you cannot use their values
  after the for ends. If you need these values, then assign them to other
  variables before breaking or exiting the loop.

3.3.6  Function Calls as Statements                           *lua53-sec3.3.6*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To allow possible side-effects, function calls can be executed as statements:
>
	stat ::= functioncall
<
In this case, all returned values are thrown away. Function calls are
explained in |lua53-sec3.4.10|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3.7  Local Declarations                                     *lua53-sec3.3.7*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Local variables can be declared anywhere inside a block. The declaration can
include an initial assignment:
>
	stat ::= local namelist ['=' explist]
<
If present, an initial assignment has the same semantics of a multiple
assignment (see |lua53-sec3.3.3|). Otherwise, all variables are initialized
with nil.
A chunk is also a block (see |lua53-sec3.3.2|), and so local variables can be
declared in a chunk outside any explicit block.
The visibility rules for local variables are explained in |lua53-sec3.5|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4  Expressions                                                *lua53-sec3.4*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The basic expressions in Lua are the following:
>
	exp ::= prefixexp
	exp ::= nil | false | true
	exp ::= Numeral
	exp ::= LiteralString
	exp ::= functiondef
	exp ::= tableconstructor
	exp ::= '...'
	exp ::= exp binop exp
	exp ::= unop exp
	prefixexp ::= var | functioncall | '(' exp ')'
<
Numerals and literal strings are explained in |lua53-sec3.1|; variables are
explained in |lua53-sec3.2|; function definitions are explained in
|lua53-sec3.4.11|; function calls are explained in |lua53-sec3.4.10|; table
constructors are explained in |lua53-sec3.4.9|. Vararg expressions, denoted by
three dots ('...'), can only be used when directly inside a vararg function;
they are explained in |lua53-sec3.4.11|.
Binary operators comprise arithmetic operators (see |lua53-sec3.4.1|), bitwise
operators (see |lua53-sec3.4.2|), relational operators (see |lua53-sec3.4.4|),
logical operators (see |lua53-sec3.4.5|), and the concatenation operator (see
|lua53-sec3.4.6|). Unary operators comprise the unary minus (see
|lua53-sec3.4.1|), the unary bitwise NOT (see |lua53-sec3.4.2|), the unary
logical not (see |lua53-sec3.4.5|), and the unary length operator (see
|lua53-sec3.4.7|).
Both function calls and vararg expressions can result in multiple values. If a
function call is used as a statement (see |lua53-sec3.3.6|), then its return
list is adjusted to zero elements, thus discarding all returned values. If an
expression is used as the last (or the only) element of a list of expressions,
then no adjustment is made (unless the expression is enclosed in parentheses).
In all other contexts, Lua adjusts the result list to one element, either
discarding all values except the first one or adding a single nil if there are
no values.
Here are some examples:
>
     f()                -- adjusted to 0 results
     g(f(), x)          -- f() is adjusted to 1 result
     g(x, f())          -- g gets x plus all results from f()
     a,b,c = f(), x     -- f() is adjusted to 1 result (c gets nil)
     a,b = ...          -- a gets the first vararg parameter, b gets
                        -- the second (both a and b can get nil if there
                        -- is no corresponding vararg parameter)
     
     a,b,c = x, f()     -- f() is adjusted to 2 results
     a,b,c = f()        -- f() is adjusted to 3 results
     return f()         -- returns all results from f()
     return ...         -- returns all received vararg parameters
     return x,y,f()     -- returns x, y, and all results from f()
     {f()}              -- creates a list with all results from f()
     {...}              -- creates a list with all vararg parameters
     {f(), nil}         -- f() is adjusted to 1 result
<
Any expression enclosed in parentheses always results in only one value. Thus,
(f(x,y,z)) is always a single value, even if f returns several values. (The
value of (f(x,y,z)) is the first value returned by f or nil if f does not
return any values.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4.1  Arithmetic Operators                                   *lua53-sec3.4.1*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua supports the following arithmetic operators:
- +:addition
- -:subtraction
- *:multiplication
- /:float division
- //:floor division
- %:modulo
- ^:exponentiation
- -:unary minus
With the exception of exponentiation and float division, the arithmetic
operators work as follows: If both operands are integers, the operation is
performed over integers and the result is an integer. Otherwise, if both
operands are numbers or strings that can be converted to numbers (see
|lua53-sec3.4.3|), then they are converted to floats, the operation is
performed following the usual rules for floating-point arithmetic (usually the
IEEE 754 standard), and the result is a float.
Exponentiation and float division (/) always convert their operands to floats
and the result is always a float. Exponentiation uses the ISO C function pow,
so that it works for non-integer exponents too.
Floor division (//) is a division that rounds the quotient towards minus
infinity, that is, the floor of the division of its operands.
Modulo is defined as the remainder of a division that rounds the quotient
towards minus infinity (floor division).
In case of overflows in integer arithmetic, all operations wrap around,
according to the usual rules of two-complement arithmetic. (In other words,
they return the unique representable integer that is equal modulo 264 to the
mathematical result.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4.2  Bitwise Operators                                      *lua53-sec3.4.2*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua supports the following bitwise operators:
- &:bitwise AND
- |:bitwise OR
- ~:bitwise exclusive OR
- >>:right shift
- <<:left shift
- ~:unary bitwise NOT
All bitwise operations convert its operands to integers (see
|lua53-sec3.4.3|), operate on all bits of those integers, and result in an
integer.
Both right and left shifts fill the vacant bits with zeros. Negative
displacements shift to the other direction; displacements with absolute values
equal to or higher than the number of bits in an integer result in zero (as
all bits are shifted out).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4.3  Coercions and Conversions                              *lua53-sec3.4.3*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua provides some automatic conversions between some types and representations
at run time. Bitwise operators always convert float operands to integers.
Exponentiation and float division always convert integer operands to floats.
All other arithmetic operations applied to mixed numbers (integers and floats)
convert the integer operand to a float; this is called the usual rule. The C
API also converts both integers to floats and floats to integers, as needed.
Moreover, string concatenation accepts numbers as arguments, besides strings.
Lua also converts strings to numbers, whenever a number is expected.
In a conversion from integer to float, if the integer value has an exact
representation as a float, that is the result. Otherwise, the conversion gets
the nearest higher or the nearest lower representable value. This kind of
conversion never fails.
The conversion from float to integer checks whether the float has an exact
representation as an integer (that is, the float has an integral value and it
is in the range of integer representation). If it does, that representation is
the result. Otherwise, the conversion fails.
The conversion from strings to numbers goes as follows: First, the string is
converted to an integer or a float, following its syntax and the rules of the
Lua lexer. (The string may have also leading and trailing spaces and a sign.)
Then, the resulting number (float or integer) is converted to the type (float
or integer) required by the context (e.g., the operation that forced the
conversion).
All conversions from strings to numbers accept both a dot and the current
locale mark as the radix character. (The Lua lexer, however, accepts only a
dot.)
The conversion from numbers to strings uses a non-specified human-readable
format. For complete control over how numbers are converted to strings, use
the format function from the string library (see |lua53-string.format|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4.4  Relational Operators                                   *lua53-sec3.4.4*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua supports the following relational operators:
- ==:equality
- ~=:inequality
- <:less than
- >:greater than
- <=:less or equal
- >=:greater or equal
These operators always result in false or true.
Equality (==) first compares the type of its operands. If the types are
different, then the result is false. Otherwise, the values of the operands are
compared. Strings are compared in the obvious way. Numbers are equal if they
denote the same mathematical value.
Tables, userdata, and threads are compared by reference: two objects are
considered equal only if they are the same object. Every time you create a new
object (a table, userdata, or thread), this new object is different from any
previously existing object. Closures with the same reference are always equal.
Closures with any detectable difference (different behavior, different
definition) are always different.
You can change the way that Lua compares tables and userdata by using the "eq"
metamethod (see |lua53-sec2.4|).
Equality comparisons do not convert strings to numbers or vice versa. Thus,
"0"==0 evaluates to false, and t[0] and t["0"] denote different entries in a
table.
The operator ~= is exactly the negation of equality (==).
The order operators work as follows. If both arguments are numbers, then they
are compared according to their mathematical values (regardless of their
subtypes). Otherwise, if both arguments are strings, then their values are
compared according to the current locale. Otherwise, Lua tries to call the
"lt" or the "le" metamethod (see |lua53-sec2.4|). A comparison a > b is
translated to b < a and a >= b is translated to b <= a.
Following the IEEE 754 standard, NaN is considered neither smaller than, nor
equal to, nor greater than any value (including itself).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4.5  Logical Operators                                      *lua53-sec3.4.5*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The logical operators in Lua are and, or, and not. Like the control structures
(see |lua53-sec3.3.4|), all logical operators consider both false and nil as
false and anything else as true.
The negation operator not always returns false or true. The conjunction
operator and returns its first argument if this value is false or nil;
otherwise, and returns its second argument. The disjunction operator or
returns its first argument if this value is different from nil and false;
otherwise, or returns its second argument. Both and and or use short-circuit
evaluation; that is, the second operand is evaluated only if necessary. Here
are some examples:
>
     10 or 20            --> 10
     10 or error()       --> 10
     nil or "a"          --> "a"
     nil and 10          --> nil
     false and error()   --> false
     false and nil       --> false
     false or nil        --> nil
     10 and 20           --> 20
<
(In this manual, --> indicates the result of the preceding expression.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4.6  Concatenation                                          *lua53-sec3.4.6*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The string concatenation operator in Lua is denoted by two dots ('..'). If
both operands are strings or numbers, then they are converted to strings
according to the rules described in |lua53-sec3.4.3|. Otherwise, the __concat
metamethod is called (see |lua53-sec2.4|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4.7  The Length Operator                                    *lua53-sec3.4.7*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The length operator is denoted by the unary prefix operator #.
The length of a string is its number of bytes (that is, the usual meaning of
string length when each character is one byte).
The length operator applied on a table returns a border in that table. A
border in a table t is any natural number that satisfies the following
condition:
>
     (border == 0 or t[border] ~= nil) and t[border + 1] == nil
<
In words, a border is any (natural) index in a table where a non-nil value is
followed by a nil value (or zero, when index 1 is nil).
A table with exactly one border is called a sequence. For instance, the table
{10, 20, 30, 40, 50} is a sequence, as it has only one border (5). The table
{10, 20, 30, nil, 50} has two borders (3 and 5), and therefore it is not a
sequence. The table {nil, 20, 30, nil, nil, 60, nil} has three borders (0, 3,
and 6), so it is not a sequence, too. The table {} is a sequence with border
0. Note that non-natural keys do not interfere with whether a table is a
sequence.
When t is a sequence, #t returns its only border, which corresponds to the
intuitive notion of the length of the sequence. When t is not a sequence, #t
can return any of its borders. (The exact one depends on details of the
internal representation of the table, which in turn can depend on how the
table was populated and the memory addresses of its non-numeric keys.)
The computation of the length of a table has a guaranteed worst time of O(log
n), where n is the largest natural key in the table.
A program can modify the behavior of the length operator for any value but
strings through the __len metamethod (see |lua53-sec2.4|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4.8  Precedence                                             *lua53-sec3.4.8*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operator precedence in Lua follows the table below, from lower to higher
priority:
>
     or
     and
     <     >     <=    >=    ~=    ==
     |
     ~
     &
     <<    >>
     ..
     +     -
     *     /     //    %
     unary operators (not   #     -     ~)
     ^
<
As usual, you can use parentheses to change the precedences of an expression.
The concatenation ('..') and exponentiation ('^') operators are right
associative. All other binary operators are left associative.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4.9  Table Constructors                                     *lua53-sec3.4.9*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Table constructors are expressions that create tables. Every time a
constructor is evaluated, a new table is created. A constructor can be used to
create an empty table or to create a table and initialize some of its fields.
The general syntax for constructors is
>
	tableconstructor ::= '{' [fieldlist] '}'
	fieldlist ::= field {fieldsep field} [fieldsep]
	field ::= '[' exp ']' '=' exp | Name '=' exp | exp
	fieldsep ::= ',' | ';'
<
Each field of the form [exp1] = exp2 adds to the new table an entry with key
exp1 and value exp2. A field of the form name = exp is equivalent to ["name"]
= exp. Finally, fields of the form exp are equivalent to [i] = exp, where i
are consecutive integers starting with 1. Fields in the other formats do not
affect this counting. For example,
>
     a = { [f(1)] = g; "x", "y"; x = 1, f(x), [30] = 23; 45 }
<
is equivalent to
>
     do
       local t = {}
       t[f(1)] = g
       t[1] = "x"         -- 1st exp
       t[2] = "y"         -- 2nd exp
       t.x = 1            -- t["x"] = 1
       t[3] = f(x)        -- 3rd exp
       t[30] = 23
       t[4] = 45          -- 4th exp
       a = t
     end
<
The order of the assignments in a constructor is undefined. (This order would
be relevant only when there are repeated keys.)
If the last field in the list has the form exp and the expression is a
function call or a vararg expression, then all values returned by this
expression enter the list consecutively (see |lua53-sec3.4.10|).
The field list can have an optional trailing separator, as a convenience for
machine-generated code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4.10  Function Calls                                       *lua53-sec3.4.10*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A function call in Lua has the following syntax:
>
	functioncall ::= prefixexp args
<
In a function call, first prefixexp and args are evaluated. If the value of
prefixexp has type function, then this function is called with the given
arguments. Otherwise, the prefixexp "call" metamethod is called, having as
first parameter the value of prefixexp, followed by the original call
arguments (see |lua53-sec2.4|).
The form
>
	functioncall ::= prefixexp ':' Name args
<
can be used to call "methods". A call v:name(args) is syntactic sugar for
v.name(v,args), except that v is evaluated only once.
Arguments have the following syntax:
>
	args ::= '(' [explist] ')'
	args ::= tableconstructor
	args ::= LiteralString
<
All argument expressions are evaluated before the call. A call of the form
f{fields} is syntactic sugar for f({fields}); that is, the argument list is a
single new table. A call of the form f'string' (or f"string" or f[[string]])
is syntactic sugar for f('string'); that is, the argument list is a single
literal string.
A call of the form return functioncall is called a tail call. Lua implements
proper tail calls (or proper tail recursion): in a tail call, the called
function reuses the stack entry of the calling function. Therefore, there is
no limit on the number of nested tail calls that a program can execute.
However, a tail call erases any debug information about the calling function.
Note that a tail call only happens with a particular syntax, where the return
has one single function call as argument; this syntax makes the calling
function return exactly the returns of the called function. So, none of the
following examples are tail calls:
>
     return (f(x))        -- results adjusted to 1
     return 2 * f(x)
     return x, f(x)       -- additional results
     f(x); return         -- results discarded
     return x or f(x)     -- results adjusted to 1
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4.11  Function Definitions                                 *lua53-sec3.4.11*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The syntax for function definition is
>
	functiondef ::= function funcbody
	funcbody ::= '(' [parlist] ')' block end
<
The following syntactic sugar simplifies function definitions:
>
	stat ::= function funcname funcbody
	stat ::= local function Name funcbody
	funcname ::= Name {'.' Name} [':' Name]
<
The statement
>
     function f () body end
<
translates to
>
     f = function () body end
<
The statement
>
     function t.a.b.c.f () body end
<
translates to
>
     t.a.b.c.f = function () body end
<
The statement
>
     local function f () body end
<
translates to
>
     local f; f = function () body end
<
not to
>
     local f = function () body end
<
(This only makes a difference when the body of the function contains
references to f.)
A function definition is an executable expression, whose value has type
function. When Lua precompiles a chunk, all its function bodies are
precompiled too. Then, whenever Lua executes the function definition, the
function is instantiated (or closed). This function instance (or closure) is
the final value of the expression.
Parameters act as local variables that are initialized with the argument
values:
>
	parlist ::= namelist [',' '...'] | '...'
<
When a function is called, the list of arguments is adjusted to the length of
the list of parameters, unless the function is a vararg function, which is
indicated by three dots ('...') at the end of its parameter list. A vararg
function does not adjust its argument list; instead, it collects all extra
arguments and supplies them to the function through a vararg expression, which
is also written as three dots. The value of this expression is a list of all
actual extra arguments, similar to a function with multiple results. If a
vararg expression is used inside another expression or in the middle of a list
of expressions, then its return list is adjusted to one element. If the
expression is used as the last element of a list of expressions, then no
adjustment is made (unless that last expression is enclosed in parentheses).
As an example, consider the following definitions:
>
     function f(a, b) end
     function g(a, b, ...) end
     function r() return 1,2,3 end
<
Then, we have the following mapping from arguments to parameters and to the

Results are returned using the return statement (see |lua53-sec3.3.4|). If
control reaches the end of a function without encountering a return statement,
then the function returns with no results.
There is a system-dependent limit on the number of values that a function may
return. This limit is guaranteed to be larger than 1000.
The colon syntax is used for defining methods, that is, functions that have an
implicit extra parameter self. Thus, the statement

     t.a.b.c.f = function (self, params) body end

3.5  Visibility Rules                                           *lua53-sec3.5*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua is a lexically scoped language. The scope of a local variable begins at
the first statement after its declaration and lasts until the last non-void
statement of the innermost block that includes the declaration. Consider the
following example:
>
     x = 10                -- global variable
     do                    -- new block
       local x = x         -- new 'x', with value 10
       print(x)            --> 10
       x = x+1
       do                  -- another block
         local x = x+1     -- another 'x'
         print(x)          --> 12
       end
       print(x)            --> 11
     end
     print(x)              --> 10  (the global one)
<
Notice that, in a declaration like local x = x, the new x being declared is
not in scope yet, and so the second x refers to the outside variable.
Because of the lexical scoping rules, local variables can be freely accessed
by functions defined inside their scope. A local variable used by an inner
function is called an upvalue, or external local variable, inside the inner
function.
Notice that each execution of a local statement defines new local variables.
Consider the following example:
>
     a = {}
     local x = 20
     for i=1,10 do
       local y = 0
       a[i] = function () y=y+1; return x+y end
     end
<
The loop creates ten closures (that is, ten instances of the anonymous
function). Each of these closures uses a different y variable, while all of
them share the same x.

4.  The Application Program Interface                             *lua53-sec4*
==============================================================================
                                                      *lua53-LUA_USE_APICHECK*

This section describes the C API for Lua, that is, the set of C functions
available to the host program to communicate with Lua. All API functions and
related types and constants are declared in the header file lua.h.
Even when we use the term "function", any facility in the API may be provided
as a macro instead. Except where stated otherwise, all such macros use each of
their arguments exactly once (except for the first argument, which is always a
Lua state), and so do not generate any hidden side-effects.
As in most C libraries, the Lua API functions do not check their arguments for
validity or consistency. However, you can change this behavior by compiling
Lua with the macro LUA_USE_APICHECK defined.
The Lua library is fully reentrant: it has no global variables. It keeps all
information it needs in a dynamic structure, called the Lua state.
Each Lua state has one or more threads, which correspond to independent,
cooperative lines of execution. The type |lua53-lua_State| (despite its name)
refers to a thread. (Indirectly, through the thread, it also refers to the Lua
state associated to the thread.)
A pointer to a thread must be passed as the first argument to every function
in the library, except to |lua53-lua_newstate|, which creates a Lua state from
scratch and returns a pointer to the main thread in the new state.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1  The Stack                                                  *lua53-sec4.1*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua uses a virtual stack to pass values to and from C. Each element in this
stack represents a Lua value (nil, number, string, etc.). Functions in the API
can access this stack through the Lua state parameter that they receive.
Whenever Lua calls C, the called function gets a new stack, which is
independent of previous stacks and of stacks of C functions that are still
active. This stack initially contains any arguments to the C function and it
is where the C function can store temporary Lua values and must push its
results to be returned to the caller (see |lua53-lua_CFunction|).
For convenience, most query operations in the API do not follow a strict stack
discipline. Instead, they can refer to any element in the stack by using an
index: A positive index represents an absolute stack position (starting at 1);
a negative index represents an offset relative to the top of the stack. More
specifically, if the stack has n elements, then index 1 represents the first
element (that is, the element that was pushed onto the stack first) and index
n represents the last element; index -1 also represents the last element (that
is, the element at the top) and index -n represents the first element.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2  Stack Size                                                 *lua53-sec4.2*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                          *lua53-LUA_MINSTACK*

When you interact with the Lua API, you are responsible for ensuring
consistency. In particular, you are responsible for controlling stack
overflow. You can use the function |lua53-lua_checkstack| to ensure that the
stack has enough space for pushing new elements.
Whenever Lua calls C, it ensures that the stack has space for at least
LUA_MINSTACK extra slots. LUA_MINSTACK is defined as 20, so that usually you
do not have to worry about stack space unless your code has loops pushing
elements onto the stack.
When you call a Lua function without a fixed number of results (see
|lua53-lua_call|), Lua ensures that the stack has enough space for all
results, but it does not ensure any extra space. So, before pushing anything
in the stack after such a call you should use |lua53-lua_checkstack|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3  Valid and Acceptable Indices                               *lua53-sec4.3*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             *lua53-LUA_TNONE*

Any function in the API that receives stack indices works only with valid
indices or acceptable indices.
A valid index is an index that refers to a position that stores a modifiable
Lua value. It comprises stack indices between 1 and the stack top (1 <=
abs(index) <= top) plus pseudo-indices, which represent some positions that
are accessible to C code but that are not in the stack. Pseudo-indices are
used to access the registry (see |lua53-sec4.5|) and the upvalues of a C
function (see |lua53-sec4.4|).
Functions that do not need a specific mutable position, but only a value
(e.g., query functions), can be called with acceptable indices. An acceptable
index can be any valid index, but it also can be any positive index after the
stack top within the space allocated for the stack, that is, indices up to the
stack size. (Note that 0 is never an acceptable index.) Except when noted
otherwise, functions in the API work with acceptable indices.
Acceptable indices serve to avoid extra tests against the stack top when
querying the stack. For instance, a C function can query its third argument
without the need to first check whether there is a third argument, that is,
without the need to check whether 3 is a valid index.
For functions that can be called with acceptable indices, any non-valid index
is treated as if it contains a value of a virtual type LUA_TNONE, which
behaves like a nil value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.4  C Closures                                                 *lua53-sec4.4*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a C function is created, it is possible to associate some values with it,
thus creating a C closure (see |lua53-lua_pushcclosure|); these values are
called upvalues and are accessible to the function whenever it is called.
Whenever a C function is called, its upvalues are located at specific
pseudo-indices. These pseudo-indices are produced by the macro
|lua53-lua_upvalueindex|. The first upvalue associated with a function is at
index lua_upvalueindex(1), and so on. Any access to lua_upvalueindex(n), where
n is greater than the number of upvalues of the current function (but not
greater than 256, which is one plus the maximum number of upvalues in a
closure), produces an acceptable but invalid index.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.5  Registry                                                   *lua53-sec4.5*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                     *lua53-LUA_REGISTRYINDEX*
                                                   *lua53-LUA_RIDX_MAINTHREAD*
                                                      *lua53-LUA_RIDX_GLOBALS*

Lua provides a registry, a predefined table that can be used by any C code to
store whatever Lua values it needs to store. The registry table is always
located at pseudo-index LUA_REGISTRYINDEX. Any C library can store data into
this table, but it must take care to choose keys that are different from those
used by other libraries, to avoid collisions. Typically, you should use as key
a string containing your library name, or a light userdata with the address of
a C object in your code, or any Lua object created by your code. As with
variable names, string keys starting with an underscore followed by uppercase
letters are reserved for Lua.
The integer keys in the registry are used by the reference mechanism (see
|lua53-luaL_ref|) and by some predefined values. Therefore, integer keys must
not be used for other purposes.
When you create a new Lua state, its registry comes with some predefined
values. These predefined values are indexed with integer keys defined as
constants in lua.h. The following constants are defined:
- LUA_RIDX_MAINTHREAD: At this index the registry has the main thread of the
  state. (The main thread is the one created together with the state.)
- LUA_RIDX_GLOBALS: At this index the registry has the global environment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.6  Error Handling in C                                        *lua53-sec4.6*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Internally, Lua uses the C longjmp facility to handle errors. (Lua will use
exceptions if you compile it as C++; search for LUAI_THROW in the source code
for details.) When Lua faces any error (such as a memory allocation error or a
type error) it raises an error; that is, it does a long jump. A protected
environment uses setjmp to set a recovery point; any error jumps to the most
recent active recovery point.
Inside a C function you can raise an error by calling |lua53-lua_error|.
Most functions in the API can raise an error, for instance due to a memory
allocation error. The documentation for each function indicates whether it can
raise errors.
If an error happens outside any protected environment, Lua calls a panic
function (see |lua53-lua_atpanic|) and then calls abort, thus exiting the host
application. Your panic function can avoid this exit by never returning (e.g.,
doing a long jump to your own recovery point outside Lua).
The panic function, as its name implies, is a mechanism of last resort.
Programs should avoid it. As a general rule, when a C function is called by
Lua with a Lua state, it can do whatever it wants on that Lua state, as it
should be already protected. However, when C code operates on other Lua states
(e.g., a Lua parameter to the function, a Lua state stored in the registry, or
the result of |lua53-lua_newthread|), it should use them only in API calls
that cannot raise errors.
The panic function runs as if it were a message handler (see |lua53-sec2.3|);
in particular, the error object is at the top of the stack. However, there is
no guarantee about stack space. To push anything on the stack, the panic
function must first check the available space (see |lua53-sec4.2|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.7  Handling Yields in C                                       *lua53-sec4.7*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Internally, Lua uses the C longjmp facility to yield a coroutine. Therefore,
if a C function foo calls an API function and this API function yields
(directly or indirectly by calling another function that yields), Lua cannot
return to foo any more, because the longjmp removes its frame from the C
stack.
To avoid this kind of problem, Lua raises an error whenever it tries to yield
across an API call, except for three functions: |lua53-lua_yieldk|,
|lua53-lua_callk|, and |lua53-lua_pcallk|. All those functions receive a
continuation function (as a parameter named k) to continue execution after a
yield.
We need to set some terminology to explain continuations. We have a C function
called from Lua which we will call the original function. This original
function then calls one of those three functions in the C API, which we will
call the callee function, that then yields the current thread. (This can
happen when the callee function is |lua53-lua_yieldk|, or when the callee
function is either |lua53-lua_callk| or |lua53-lua_pcallk| and the function
called by them yields.)
Suppose the running thread yields while executing the callee function. After
the thread resumes, it eventually will finish running the callee function.
However, the callee function cannot return to the original function, because
its frame in the C stack was destroyed by the yield. Instead, Lua calls a
continuation function, which was given as an argument to the callee function.
As the name implies, the continuation function should continue the task of the
original function.
As an illustration, consider the following function:
>
     int original_function (lua_State *L) {
       ...     /* code 1 */
       status = lua_pcall(L, n, m, h);  /* calls Lua */
       ...     /* code 2 */
     }
<
Now we want to allow the Lua code being run by |lua53-lua_pcall| to yield.
First, we can rewrite our function like here:
>
     int k (lua_State *L, int status, lua_KContext ctx) {
       ...  /* code 2 */
     }
     
     int original_function (lua_State *L) {
       ...     /* code 1 */
       return k(L, lua_pcall(L, n, m, h), ctx);
     }
<
In the above code, the new function k is a continuation function (with type
|lua53-lua_KFunction|), which should do all the work that the original
function was doing after calling |lua53-lua_pcall|. Now, we must inform Lua
that it must call k if the Lua code being executed by |lua53-lua_pcall| gets
interrupted in some way (errors or yielding), so we rewrite the code as here,
replacing |lua53-lua_pcall| by |lua53-lua_pcallk|:
>
     int original_function (lua_State *L) {
       ...     /* code 1 */
       return k(L, lua_pcallk(L, n, m, h, ctx2, k), ctx1);
     }
<
Note the external, explicit call to the continuation: Lua will call the
continuation only if needed, that is, in case of errors or resuming after a
yield. If the called function returns normally without ever yielding,
|lua53-lua_pcallk| (and |lua53-lua_callk|) will also return normally. (Of
course, instead of calling the continuation in that case, you can do the
equivalent work directly inside the original function.)
Besides the Lua state, the continuation function has two other parameters: the
final status of the call plus the context value (ctx) that was passed
originally to |lua53-lua_pcallk|. (Lua does not use this context value; it
only passes this value from the original function to the continuation
function.) For |lua53-lua_pcallk|, the status is the same value that would be
returned by |lua53-lua_pcallk|, except that it is LUA_YIELD
(|lua53-LUA_YIELD|) when being executed after a yield (instead of LUA_OK
(|lua53-LUA_OK|)). For |lua53-lua_yieldk| and |lua53-lua_callk|, the status is
always LUA_YIELD (|lua53-LUA_YIELD|) when Lua calls the continuation. (For
these two functions, Lua will not call the continuation in case of errors,
because they do not handle errors.) Similarly, when using |lua53-lua_callk|,
you should call the continuation function with LUA_OK (|lua53-LUA_OK|) as the
status. (For |lua53-lua_yieldk|, there is not much point in calling directly
the continuation function, because |lua53-lua_yieldk| usually does not
return.)
Lua treats the continuation function as if it were the original function. The
continuation function receives the same Lua stack from the original function,
in the same state it would be if the callee function had returned. (For
instance, after a |lua53-lua_callk| the function and its arguments are removed
from the stack and replaced by the results from the call.) It also has the
same upvalues. Whatever it returns is handled by Lua as if it were the return
of the original function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.8  Functions and Types                                        *lua53-sec4.8*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here we list all functions and types from the C API in alphabetical order.
Each function has an indicator like this:
                                                                   [-o, +p, x]
The first field, o, is how many elements the function pops from the stack. The
second field, p, is how many elements the function pushes onto the stack. (Any
function always pushes its results after popping its arguments.) A field in
the form x|y means the function can push (or pop) x or y elements, depending
on the situation; an interrogation mark '?' means that we cannot know how many
elements the function pops/pushes by looking only at its arguments (e.g., they
may depend on what is on the stack). The third field, x, tells whether the
function may raise errors: '-' means the function never raises any error; 'm'
means the function may raise out-of-memory errors and errors running a __gc
metamethod; 'e' means the function may raise any errors (it can run arbitrary
Lua code, either directly or through metamethods); 'v' means the function may
raise an error on purpose.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua53-lua_absindex*
lua_absindex ~
                                                                   [-0, +0, -]
>
    int lua_absindex (lua_State *L, int idx);
<
Converts the acceptable index idx into an equivalent absolute index (that is,
one that does not depend on the stack top).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua53-lua_Alloc*
lua_Alloc ~
>
    typedef void * (*lua_Alloc) (void *ud,
                                 void *ptr,
                                 size_t osize,
                                 size_t nsize);
<
The type of the memory-allocation function used by Lua states. The allocator
function must provide a functionality similar to realloc, but not exactly the
same. Its arguments are ud, an opaque pointer passed to |lua53-lua_newstate|;
ptr, a pointer to the block being allocated/reallocated/freed; osize, the
original size of the block or some code about what is being allocated; and
nsize, the new size of the block.
When ptr is not NULL, osize is the size of the block pointed by ptr, that is,
the size given when it was allocated or reallocated.
When ptr is NULL, osize encodes the kind of object that Lua is allocating.
osize is any of LUA_TSTRING (|lua53-LUA_TSTRING|), LUA_TTABLE
(|lua53-LUA_TTABLE|), LUA_TFUNCTION (|lua53-LUA_TFUNCTION|), LUA_TUSERDATA
(|lua53-LUA_TUSERDATA|), or LUA_TTHREAD (|lua53-LUA_TTHREAD|) when (and only
when) Lua is creating a new object of that type. When osize is some other
value, Lua is allocating memory for something else.
Lua assumes the following behavior from the allocator function:
When nsize is zero, the allocator must behave like free and return NULL.
When nsize is not zero, the allocator must behave like realloc. The allocator
returns NULL if and only if it cannot fulfill the request. Lua assumes that
the allocator never fails when osize >= nsize.
Here is a simple implementation for the allocator function. It is used in the
auxiliary library by |lua53-luaL_newstate|.
>
     static void *l_alloc (void *ud, void *ptr, size_t osize,
                                                size_t nsize) {
       (void)ud;  (void)osize;  /* not used */
       if (nsize == 0) {
         free(ptr);
         return NULL;
       }
       else
         return realloc(ptr, nsize);
     }
<
Note that Standard C ensures that free(NULL) has no effect and that
realloc(NULL,size) is equivalent to malloc(size). This code assumes that
realloc does not fail when shrinking a block. (Although Standard C does not
ensure this behavior, it seems to be a safe assumption.)

Performs an arithmetic or bitwise operation over the two values (or one, in
the case of negations) at the top of the stack, with the value at the top
being the second operand, pops these values, and pushes the result of the
operation. The function follows the semantics of the corresponding Lua
operator (that is, it may call metamethods).
The value of op must be one of the following constants:
- LUA_OPADD: performs addition (+)
- LUA_OPSUB: performs subtraction (-)
- LUA_OPMUL: performs multiplication (*)
- LUA_OPDIV: performs float division (/)
- LUA_OPIDIV: performs floor division (//)

    void lua_call (lua_State *L, int nargs, int nresults);
<
Calls a function.
To call a function you must use the following protocol: first, the function to
be called is pushed onto the stack; then, the arguments to the function are
pushed in direct order; that is, the first argument is pushed first. Finally
you call |lua53-lua_call|; nargs is the number of arguments that you pushed
onto the stack. All arguments and the function value are popped from the stack
when the function is called. The function results are pushed onto the stack
when the function returns. The number of results is adjusted to nresults,
unless nresults is LUA_MULTRET. In this case, all results from the function
are pushed; Lua takes care that the returned values fit into the stack space,
but it does not ensure any extra space in the stack. The function results are
pushed onto the stack in direct order (the first result is pushed first), so
that after the call the last result is on the top of the stack.
Any error inside the called function is propagated upwards (with a longjmp).
The following example shows how the host program can do the equivalent to this
Lua code:
>
     a = f("how", t.x, 14)
<
Here it is in C:
>
     lua_getglobal(L, "f");                  /* function to be called */
     lua_pushliteral(L, "how");                       /* 1st argument */
     lua_getglobal(L, "t");                    /* table to be indexed */
     lua_getfield(L, -1, "x");        /* push result of t.x (2nd arg) */
     lua_remove(L, -2);                  /* remove 't' from the stack */
     lua_pushinteger(L, 14);                          /* 3rd argument */
     lua_call(L, 3, 1);     /* call 'f' with 3 arguments and 1 result */
     lua_setglobal(L, "a");                         /* set global 'a' */
<
Note that the code above is balanced: at its end, the stack is back to its
original configuration. This is considered good programming practice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua53-lua_callk*

                    lua_KContext ctx,
                    lua_KFunction k);
<
This function behaves exactly like |lua53-lua_call|, but allows the called
function to yield (see |lua53-sec4.7|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                         *lua53-lua_CFunction*
lua_CFunction ~
>
    typedef int (*lua_CFunction) (lua_State *L);
<
Type for C functions.
In order to communicate properly with Lua, a C function must use the following
protocol, which defines the way parameters and results are passed: a C
function receives its arguments from Lua in its stack in direct order (the
first argument is pushed first). So, when the function starts, lua_gettop(L)
returns the number of arguments received by the function. The first argument
(if any) is at index 1 and its last argument is at index lua_gettop(L). To
return values to Lua, a C function just pushes them onto the stack, in direct
order (the first result is pushed first), and returns the number of results.
Any other value in the stack below the results will be properly discarded by
Lua. Like a Lua function, a C function called by Lua can also return many
results.
As an example, the following function receives a variable number of numeric
arguments and returns their average and their sum:
>
     static int foo (lua_State *L) {
       int n = lua_gettop(L);    /* number of arguments */
       lua_Number sum = 0.0;
       int i;
       for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
         if (!lua_isnumber(L, i)) {
           lua_pushliteral(L, "incorrect argument");
           lua_error(L);
         }
         sum += lua_tonumber(L, i);
       }
       lua_pushnumber(L, sum/n);        /* first result */
       lua_pushnumber(L, sum);         /* second result */
       return 2;                   /* number of results */
     }
<

    int lua_checkstack (lua_State *L, int n);
<
Ensures that the stack has space for at least n extra slots (that is, that you
can safely push up to n values into it). It returns false if it cannot fulfill
the request, either because it would cause the stack to be larger than a fixed
maximum size (typically at least several thousand elements) or because it
cannot allocate memory for the extra space. This function never shrinks the
stack; if the stack already has space for the extra slots, it is left
unchanged.

>
    void lua_close (lua_State *L);
<
Destroys all objects in the given Lua state (calling the corresponding
garbage-collection metamethods, if any) and frees all dynamic memory used by
this state. On several platforms, you may not need to call this function,
because all resources are naturally released when the host program ends. On
the other hand, long-running programs that create multiple states, such as
daemons or web servers, will probably need to close states as soon as they are
not needed.

    int lua_compare (lua_State *L, int index1, int index2, int op);
<
Compares two Lua values. Returns 1 if the value at index index1 satisfies op
when compared with the value at index index2, following the semantics of the
corresponding Lua operator (that is, it may call metamethods). Otherwise
returns 0. Also returns 0 if any of the indices is not valid.
The value of op must be one of the following constants:
- LUA_OPEQ: compares for equality (==)
- LUA_OPLT: compares for less than (<)
- LUA_OPLE: compares for less or equal (<=)

    void lua_concat (lua_State *L, int n);
<
Concatenates the n values at the top of the stack, pops them, and leaves the
result at the top. If n is 1, the result is the single value on the stack
(that is, the function does nothing); if n is 0, the result is the empty
string. Concatenation is performed following the usual semantics of Lua (see
|lua53-sec3.4.6|).

    void lua_createtable (lua_State *L, int narr, int nrec);
<
Creates a new empty table and pushes it onto the stack. Parameter narr is a
hint for how many elements the table will have as a sequence; parameter nrec
is a hint for how many other elements the table will have. Lua may use these
hints to preallocate memory for the new table. This preallocation is useful
for performance when you know in advance how many elements the table will
have. Otherwise you can use the function |lua53-lua_newtable|.

                            int strip);
<
Dumps a function as a binary chunk. Receives a Lua function on the top of the
stack and produces a binary chunk that, if loaded again, results in a function
equivalent to the one dumped. As it produces parts of the chunk,
|lua53-lua_dump| calls function writer (see |lua53-lua_Writer|) with the given
data to write them.
If strip is true, the binary representation may not include all debug
information about the function, to save space.
The value returned is the error code returned by the last call to the writer;
0 means no errors.
This function does not pop the Lua function from the stack.

Generates a Lua error, using the value at the top of the stack as the error

>
    int lua_gc (lua_State *L, int what, int data);
<
Controls the garbage collector.
This function performs several tasks, according to the value of the parameter
what:
- LUA_GCSTOP: stops the garbage collector.
- LUA_GCRESTART: restarts the garbage collector.
- LUA_GCCOLLECT: performs a full garbage-collection cycle.
- LUA_GCCOUNT: returns the current amount of memory (in Kbytes) in use by Lua.
- LUA_GCCOUNTB: returns the remainder of dividing the current amount of bytes
  of memory in use by Lua by 1024.
- LUA_GCSTEP: performs an incremental step of garbage collection.
- LUA_GCSETPAUSE: sets data as the new value for the pause of the collector
  (see |lua53-sec2.5|) and returns the previous value of the pause.
- LUA_GCSETSTEPMUL: sets data as the new value for the step multiplier of the
  collector (see |lua53-sec2.5|) and returns the previous value of the step
  multiplier.
- LUA_GCISRUNNING: returns a boolean that tells whether the collector is
  running (i.e., not stopped).

Returns a pointer to a raw memory area associated with the given Lua state.
The application can use this area for any purpose; Lua does not use it for
anything.
Each new thread has this area initialized with a copy of the area of the main

By default, this area has the size of a pointer to void, but you can recompile
Lua with a different size for this area. (See LUA_EXTRASPACE in luaconf.h.)

                  const char *chunkname,
                  const char *mode);
<
Loads a Lua chunk without running it. If there are no errors, lua_load pushes
the compiled chunk as a Lua function on top of the stack. Otherwise, it pushes
an error message.
The return values of lua_load are:
- LUA_OK (|lua53-LUA_OK|): no errors;
- LUA_ERRSYNTAX: syntax error during precompilation;
- LUA_ERRMEM (|lua53-LUA_ERRMEM|): memory allocation (out-of-memory) error;
- LUA_ERRGCMM (|lua53-LUA_ERRGCMM|): error while running a __gc metamethod.
  (This error has no relation with the chunk being loaded. It is generated by
  the garbage collector.)
The lua_load function uses a user-supplied reader function to read the chunk
(see |lua53-lua_Reader|). The data argument is an opaque value passed to the
reader function.
The chunkname argument gives a name to the chunk, which is used for error
messages and in debug information (see |lua53-sec4.9|).
lua_load automatically detects whether the chunk is text or binary and loads
it accordingly (see program luac). The string mode works as in function
|lua53-load|, with the addition that a NULL value is equivalent to the string
"bt".
lua_load uses the stack internally, so the reader function must always leave
the stack unmodified when returning.
If the resulting function has upvalues, its first upvalue is set to the value
of the global environment stored at index LUA_RIDX_GLOBALS in the registry
(see |lua53-sec4.5|). When loading main chunks, this upvalue will be the _ENV
variable (see |lua53-sec2.2|). Other upvalues are initialized with nil.

    lua_State *lua_newstate (lua_Alloc f, void *ud);
<
Creates a new thread running in a new, independent state. Returns NULL if it
cannot create the thread or the state (due to lack of memory). The argument f
is the allocator function; Lua does all memory allocation for this state
through this function (see |lua53-lua_Alloc|). The second argument, ud, is an
opaque pointer that Lua passes to the allocator in every call.

>
    lua_State *lua_newthread (lua_State *L);
<
Creates a new thread, pushes it on the stack, and returns a pointer to a
|lua53-lua_State| that represents this new thread. The new thread returned by
this function shares with the original thread its global environment, but has
an independent execution stack.
There is no explicit function to close or to destroy a thread. Threads are
subject to garbage collection, like any Lua object.

>
    int lua_next (lua_State *L, int index);
<
Pops a key from the stack, and pushes a key-value pair from the table at the
given index (the "next" pair after the given key). If there are no more
elements in the table, then |lua53-lua_next| returns 0 (and pushes nothing).
A typical traversal looks like this:
>
     /* table is in the stack at index 't' */
     lua_pushnil(L);  /* first key */
     while (lua_next(L, t) != 0) {
       /* uses 'key' (at index -2) and 'value' (at index -1) */
       printf("%s - %s\n",
              lua_typename(L, lua_type(L, -2)),
              lua_typename(L, lua_type(L, -1)));
       /* removes 'value'; keeps 'key' for next iteration */
       lua_pop(L, 1);
     }
<
While traversing a table, do not call |lua53-lua_tolstring| directly on a key,
unless you know that the key is actually a string. Recall that
|lua53-lua_tolstring| may change the value at the given index; this confuses
the next call to |lua53-lua_next|.
See function |lua53-next| for the caveats of modifying the table during its
traversal.

    int lua_numbertointeger (lua_Number n, lua_Integer *p);
<
Converts a Lua float to a Lua integer. This macro assumes that n has an
integral value. If that value is within the range of Lua integers, it is
converted to an integer and assigned to *p. The macro results in a boolean
indicating whether the conversion was successful. (Note that this range test
can be tricky to do correctly without this macro, due to roundings.)
This macro may evaluate its arguments more than once.

>
    int lua_pcall (lua_State *L, int nargs, int nresults, int msgh);
<
Calls a function in protected mode.
Both nargs and nresults have the same meaning as in |lua53-lua_call|. If there
are no errors during the call, |lua53-lua_pcall| behaves exactly like
|lua53-lua_call|. However, if there is any error, |lua53-lua_pcall| catches
it, pushes a single value on the stack (the error object), and returns an
error code. Like |lua53-lua_call|, |lua53-lua_pcall| always removes the
function and its arguments from the stack.
If msgh is 0, then the error object returned on the stack is exactly the
original error object. Otherwise, msgh is the stack index of a message
handler. (This index cannot be a pseudo-index.) In case of runtime errors,
this function will be called with the error object and its return value will
be the object returned on the stack by |lua53-lua_pcall|.
Typically, the message handler is used to add more debug information to the
error object, such as a stack traceback. Such information cannot be gathered
after the return of |lua53-lua_pcall|, since by then the stack has unwound.
The |lua53-lua_pcall| function returns one of the following constants (defined
in lua.h):
- LUA_OK (0): success.
- LUA_ERRRUN: a runtime error.
- LUA_ERRMEM: memory allocation error. For such errors, Lua does not call the
  message handler.
- LUA_ERRERR: error while running the message handler.
- LUA_ERRGCMM: error while running a __gc metamethod. For such errors, Lua
  does not call the message handler (as this kind of error typically has no
  relation with the function being called).

>
    void lua_pushcclosure (lua_State *L, lua_CFunction fn, int n);
<
Pushes a new C closure onto the stack.
When a C function is created, it is possible to associate some values with it,
thus creating a C closure (see |lua53-sec4.4|); these values are then
accessible to the function whenever it is called. To associate values with a C
function, first these values must be pushed onto the stack (when there are
multiple values, the first value is pushed first). Then
|lua53-lua_pushcclosure| is called to create and push the C function onto the
stack, with the argument n telling how many values will be associated with the
function. |lua53-lua_pushcclosure| also pops these values from the stack.
The maximum value for n is 255.
When n is zero, this function creates a light C function, which is just a
pointer to the C function. In that case, it never raises a memory error.

>
    void lua_pushcfunction (lua_State *L, lua_CFunction f);
<
Pushes a C function onto the stack. This function receives a pointer to a C
function and pushes onto the stack a Lua value of type function that, when
called, invokes the corresponding C function.
Any function to be callable by Lua must follow the correct protocol to receive
its parameters and return its results (see |lua53-lua_CFunction|).

>
    const char *lua_pushfstring (lua_State *L, const char *fmt, ...);
<
Pushes onto the stack a formatted string and returns a pointer to this string.
It is similar to the ISO C function sprintf, but has some important
differences:
- You do not have to allocate space for the result: the result is a Lua string
  and Lua takes care of memory allocation (and deallocation, through garbage
  collection).
- The conversion specifiers are quite restricted. There are no flags, widths,
  or precisions. The conversion specifiers can only be '%%' (inserts the
  character '%'), '%s' (inserts a zero-terminated string, with no size
  restrictions), '%f' (inserts a |lua53-lua_Number|), '%I' (inserts a
  |lua53-lua_Integer|), '%p' (inserts a pointer as a hexadecimal numeral),
  '%d' (inserts an int), '%c' (inserts an int as a one-byte character), and
  '%U' (inserts a long int as a UTF-8 byte sequence).
Unlike other push functions, this function checks for the stack space it
needs, including the slot for its result.

Pushes a light userdata onto the stack.
Userdata represent C values in Lua. A light userdata represents a pointer, a

individual metatable, and it is not collected (as it was never created). A
light userdata is equal to "any" light userdata with the same C address.

    int lua_resume (lua_State *L, lua_State *from, int nargs);
<
Starts and resumes a coroutine in the given thread L.
To start a coroutine, you push onto the thread stack the main function plus
any arguments; then you call |lua53-lua_resume|, with nargs being the number
of arguments. This call returns when the coroutine suspends or finishes its
execution. When it returns, the stack contains all values passed to
|lua53-lua_yield|, or all values returned by the body function.
|lua53-lua_resume| returns LUA_YIELD (|lua53-LUA_YIELD|) if the coroutine
yields, LUA_OK (|lua53-LUA_OK|) if the coroutine finishes its execution
without errors, or an error code in case of errors (see |lua53-lua_pcall|).
In case of errors, the stack is not unwound, so you can use the debug API over
it. The error object is on the top of the stack.
To resume a coroutine, you remove any results from the last |lua53-lua_yield|,
put on its stack only the values to be passed as results from yield, and then
call |lua53-lua_resume|.
The parameter from represents the coroutine that is resuming L. If there is no
such coroutine, this parameter can be NULL.

lua_State ~
>
    typedef struct lua_State lua_State;
<
An opaque structure that points to a thread and indirectly (through the
thread) to the whole state of a Lua interpreter. The Lua library is fully
reentrant: it has no global variables. All information about a state is
accessible through this structure.
A pointer to this structure must be passed as the first argument to every
function in the library, except to |lua53-lua_newstate|, which creates a Lua
state from scratch.

    int lua_status (lua_State *L);

Returns the status of the thread L.
The status can be 0 (LUA_OK (|lua53-LUA_OK|)) for a normal thread, an error
code if the thread finished the execution of a |lua53-lua_resume| with an
error, or LUA_YIELD if the thread is suspended.
You can only call functions in threads with status LUA_OK (|lua53-LUA_OK|).
You can resume threads with status LUA_OK (|lua53-LUA_OK|) (to start a new
coroutine) or LUA_YIELD (|lua53-LUA_YIELD|) (to resume a coroutine).

    size_t lua_stringtonumber (lua_State *L, const char *s);
<
Converts the zero-terminated string s to a number, pushes that number into the
stack, and returns the total size of the string, that is, its length plus one.
The conversion can result in an integer or a float, according to the lexical
conventions of Lua (see |lua53-sec3.1|). The string may have leading and
trailing spaces and a sign. If the string is not a valid numeral, returns 0
and pushes nothing. (Note that the result can be used as a boolean, true if
the conversion succeeds.)

>
    int lua_toboolean (lua_State *L, int index);
<
Converts the Lua value at the given index to a C boolean value (0 or 1). Like
all tests in Lua, |lua53-lua_toboolean| returns true for any Lua value
different from false and nil; otherwise it returns false. (If you want to
accept only actual boolean values, use |lua53-lua_isboolean| to test the
value's type.)

>
    lua_Integer lua_tointegerx (lua_State *L, int index, int *isnum);
<
Converts the Lua value at the given index to the signed integral type
|lua53-lua_Integer|. The Lua value must be an integer, or a number or string
convertible to an integer (see |lua53-sec3.4.3|); otherwise, lua_tointegerx
returns 0.
If isnum is not NULL, its referent is assigned a boolean value that indicates
whether the operation succeeded.

>
    const char *lua_tolstring (lua_State *L, int index, size_t *len);
<
Converts the Lua value at the given index to a C string. If len is not NULL,
it sets *len with the string length. The Lua value must be a string or a
number; otherwise, the function returns NULL. If the value is a number, then
lua_tolstring also changes the actual value in the stack to a string. (This
change confuses |lua53-lua_next| when lua_tolstring is applied to keys during
a table traversal.)
lua_tolstring returns a pointer to a string inside the Lua state. This string
always has a zero ('\0') after its last character (as in C), but can contain
other zeros in its body.
Because Lua has garbage collection, there is no guarantee that the pointer
returned by lua_tolstring will be valid after the corresponding Lua value is
removed from the stack.

convertible to a number (see |lua53-sec3.4.3|); otherwise,

Converts the value at the given index to a generic C pointer (void*). The
value can be a userdata, a table, a thread, or a function; otherwise,
lua_topointer returns NULL. Different objects will give different pointers.
There is no way to convert the pointer back to its original value.
Typically this function is used only for hashing and debug information.

<
Yields a coroutine (thread).
When a C function calls |lua53-lua_yieldk|, the running coroutine suspends its
execution, and the call to |lua53-lua_resume| that started this coroutine
returns. The parameter nresults is the number of values from the stack that
will be passed as results to |lua53-lua_resume|.
When the coroutine is resumed again, Lua calls the given continuation function
k to continue the execution of the C function that yielded (see
|lua53-sec4.7|). This continuation function receives the same stack from the
previous function, with the n results removed and replaced by the arguments
passed to |lua53-lua_resume|. Moreover, the continuation function receives the
value ctx that was passed to |lua53-lua_yieldk|.
Usually, this function does not return; when the coroutine eventually resumes,
it continues executing the continuation function. However, there is one
special case, which is when this function is called from inside a line or a
count hook (see |lua53-sec4.9|). In that case, lua_yieldk should be called
with no continuation (probably in the form of |lua53-lua_yield|) and no
results, and the hook should return immediately after the call. Lua will yield
and, when the coroutine resumes again, it will continue the normal execution
of the (Lua) function that triggered the hook.
This function can raise an error if it is called from a thread with a pending
C call with no continuation function, or it is called from a thread that is
not running inside a resume (e.g., the main thread).

4.9  The Debug Interface                                        *lua53-sec4.9*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua has no built-in debugging facilities. Instead, it offers a special
interface by means of functions and hooks. This interface allows the
construction of different kinds of debuggers, profilers, and other tools that
need "inside information" from the interpreter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<
A structure used to carry different pieces of information about a function or
an activation record. |lua53-lua_getstack| fills only the private part of this
structure, for later use. To fill the other fields of |lua53-lua_Debug| with
useful information, call |lua53-lua_getinfo|.
The fields of |lua53-lua_Debug| have the following meaning:
- source: the name of the chunk that created the function. If source starts
  with a '@', it means that the function was defined in a file where the file
  name follows the '@'. If source starts with a '=', the remainder of its
  contents describe the source in a user-dependent manner. Otherwise, the
  function was defined in a string where source is that string.
- short_src: a "printable" version of source, to be used in error messages.
- linedefined: the line number where the definition of the function starts.
- lastlinedefined: the line number where the definition of the function ends.
- what: the string "Lua" if the function is a Lua function, "C" if it is a C
  function, "main" if it is the main part of a chunk.
- currentline: the current line where the given function is executing. When no
  line information is available, currentline is set to -1.
- name: a reasonable name for the given function. Because functions in Lua are
  first-class values, they do not have a fixed name: some functions can be the
  value of multiple global variables, while others can be stored only in a
  table field. The lua_getinfo function checks how the function was called to
  find a suitable name. If it cannot find a name, then name is set to NULL.
- namewhat: explains the name field. The value of namewhat can be "global",
  "local", "method", "field", "upvalue", or "" (the empty string), according
  to how the function was called. (Lua uses the empty string when no other
  option seems to apply.)
- istailcall: true if this function invocation was called by a tail call. In
  this case, the caller of this level is not in the stack.
- nups: the number of upvalues of the function.
- nparams: the number of fixed parameters of the function (always 0 for C
  functions).
- isvararg: true if the function is a vararg function (always true for C
  functions).

    int lua_getinfo (lua_State *L, const char *what, lua_Debug *ar);
<
Gets information about a specific function or function invocation.
To get information about a function invocation, the parameter ar must be a
valid activation record that was filled by a previous call to
|lua53-lua_getstack| or given as argument to a hook (see |lua53-lua_Hook|).
To get information about a function you push it onto the stack and start the
what string with the character '>'. (In that case, lua_getinfo pops the
function from the top of the stack.) For instance, to know in which line a
function f was defined, you can write the following code:
>
     lua_Debug ar;
     lua_getglobal(L, "f");  /* get global 'f' */
     lua_getinfo(L, ">S", &ar);
     printf("%d\n", ar.linedefined);
<
Each character in the string what selects some fields of the structure ar to
be filled or a value to be pushed on the stack:
- 'n': fills in the field name and namewhat;
- 'S': fills in the fields source, short_src, linedefined, lastlinedefined,
  and what;
- 'l': fills in the field currentline;
- 't': fills in the field istailcall;
- 'u': fills in the fields nups, nparams, and isvararg;
- 'f': pushes onto the stack the function that is running at the given level;
- 'L': pushes onto the stack a table whose indices are the numbers of the
  lines that are valid on the function. (A valid line is a line with some
  associated code, that is, a line where you can put a break point. Non-valid
  lines include empty lines and comments.)
  If this option is given together with option 'f', its table is pushed after
  the function.
This function returns 0 on error (for instance, an invalid option in what).

>
    const char *lua_getlocal (lua_State *L, const lua_Debug *ar, int n);
<
Gets information about a local variable of a given activation record or a
given function.
In the first case, the parameter ar must be a valid activation record that was
filled by a previous call to |lua53-lua_getstack| or given as argument to a
hook (see |lua53-lua_Hook|). The index n selects which local variable to
inspect; see |lua53-debug.getlocal| for details about variable indices and
names.
|lua53-lua_getlocal| pushes the variable's value onto the stack and returns
its name.
In the second case, ar must be NULL and the function to be inspected must be
at the top of the stack. In this case, only parameters of Lua functions are
visible (as there is no information about what variables are active) and no
values are pushed onto the stack.
Returns NULL (and pushes nothing) when the index is greater than the number of
active local variables.

    int lua_getstack (lua_State *L, int level, lua_Debug *ar);
<
Gets information about the interpreter runtime stack.
This function fills parts of a |lua53-lua_Debug| structure with an
identification of the activation record of the function executing at a given
level. Level 0 is the current running function, whereas level n+1 is the
function that has called level n (except for tail calls, which do not count on
the stack). When there are no errors, |lua53-lua_getstack| returns 1; when
called with a level greater than the stack depth, it returns 0.

>
    const char *lua_getupvalue (lua_State *L, int funcindex, int n);
<
Gets information about the n-th upvalue of the closure at index funcindex. It
pushes the upvalue's value onto the stack and returns its name. Returns NULL
(and pushes nothing) when the index n is greater than the number of upvalues.
For C functions, this function uses the empty string "" as a name for all
upvalues. (For Lua functions, upvalues are the external local variables that
the function uses, and that are consequently included in its closure.)
Upvalues have no particular order, as they are active through the whole
function. They are numbered in an arbitrary order.

lua_Hook ~
>
    typedef void (*lua_Hook) (lua_State *L, lua_Debug *ar);
<
Type for debugging hook functions.
Whenever a hook is called, its ar argument has its field event set to the
specific event that triggered the hook. Lua identifies these events with the
following constants: LUA_HOOKCALL, LUA_HOOKRET, LUA_HOOKTAILCALL,
LUA_HOOKLINE, and LUA_HOOKCOUNT. Moreover, for line events, the field
currentline is also set. To get the value of any other field in ar, the hook
must call |lua53-lua_getinfo|.
For call events, event can be LUA_HOOKCALL, the normal value, or
LUA_HOOKTAILCALL, for a tail call; in this case, there will be no
corresponding return event.
While Lua is running a hook, it disables other calls to hooks. Therefore, if a
hook calls back Lua to execute a function or a chunk, this execution occurs
without any calls to hooks.
Hook functions cannot have continuations, that is, they cannot call
|lua53-lua_yieldk|, |lua53-lua_pcallk|, or |lua53-lua_callk| with a non-null
k.
Hook functions can yield under the following conditions: Only count and line
events can yield; to yield, a hook function must finish its execution calling
|lua53-lua_yield| with nresults equal to zero (that is, with no values).

>
    void lua_sethook (lua_State *L, lua_Hook f, int mask, int count);
<
Sets the debugging hook function.
Argument f is the hook function. mask specifies on which events the hook will
be called: it is formed by a bitwise OR of the constants LUA_MASKCALL,
LUA_MASKRET, LUA_MASKLINE, and LUA_MASKCOUNT. The count argument is only
meaningful when the mask includes LUA_MASKCOUNT. For each event, the hook is
called as explained below:
- The call hook: is called when the interpreter calls a function. The hook is
  called just after Lua enters the new function, before the function gets its
  arguments.
- The return hook: is called when the interpreter returns from a function. The
  hook is called just before Lua leaves the function. There is no standard way
  to access the values to be returned by the function.
- The line hook: is called when the interpreter is about to start the
  execution of a new line of code, or when it jumps back in the code (even to
  the same line). (This event only happens while Lua is executing a Lua
  function.)
- The count hook: is called after the interpreter executes every count
  instructions. (This event only happens while Lua is executing a Lua
  function.)
A hook is disabled by setting mask to zero.

5.  The Auxiliary Library                                         *lua53-sec5*
==============================================================================

The auxiliary library provides several convenient functions to interface C
with Lua. While the basic API provides the primitive functions for all
interactions between C and Lua, the auxiliary library provides higher-level
functions for some common tasks.
All functions and types from the auxiliary library are defined in header file
lauxlib.h and have a prefix luaL_.
All functions in the auxiliary library are built on top of the basic API, and
so they provide nothing that cannot be done with that API. Nevertheless, the
use of the auxiliary library ensures more consistency to your code.
Several functions in the auxiliary library use internally some extra stack
slots. When a function in the auxiliary library uses less than five slots, it
does not check the stack size; it simply assumes that there are enough slots.
Several functions in the auxiliary library are used to check C function
arguments. Because the error message is formatted for arguments (e.g., "bad
argument #1"), you should not use these functions for other stack values.
Functions called luaL_check* always raise an error if the check is not
satisfied.

luaL_Buffer ~
>
    typedef struct luaL_Buffer luaL_Buffer;
<
Type for a string buffer.
A string buffer allows C code to build Lua strings piecemeal. Its pattern of
use is as follows:
- First declare a variable b of type |lua53-luaL_Buffer|.
- Then initialize it with a call luaL_buffinit(L, &b).
- Then add string pieces to the buffer calling any of the luaL_add* functions.
- Finish by calling luaL_pushresult(&b). This call leaves the final string on
  the top of the stack.
If you know beforehand the total size of the resulting string, you can use the
buffer like this:
- First declare a variable b of type |lua53-luaL_Buffer|.
- Then initialize it and preallocate a space of size sz with a call
  luaL_buffinitsize(L, &b, sz).
- Then copy the string into that space.
- Finish by calling luaL_pushresultsize(&b, sz), where sz is the total size of
  the resulting string copied into that space.
During its normal operation, a string buffer uses a variable number of stack
slots. So, while using a buffer, you cannot assume that you know where the top
of the stack is. You can use the stack between successive calls to buffer
operations as long as that use is balanced; that is, when you call a buffer
operation, the stack is at the same level it was immediately after the
previous buffer operation. (The only exception to this rule is
|lua53-luaL_addvalue|.) After calling |lua53-luaL_pushresult| the stack is
back to its level when the buffer was initialized, plus the final string on
its top.

this function calls this field passing the object as its only argument. In
this case this function returns true and pushes onto the stack the value
returned by the call. If there is no metatable or no metamethod, this function
returns false (without pushing any value on the stack).

<
Checks whether the function argument arg is a string and searches for this
string in the array lst (which must be NULL-terminated). Returns the index in
the array where the string was found. Raises an error if the argument is not a
string or if the string cannot be found.
If def is not NULL, the function uses def as a default value when there is no
argument arg or when this argument is nil.
This is a useful function for mapping strings to C enums. (The usual
convention in Lua libraries is to use strings instead of numbers to select
options.)

<
Loads a file as a Lua chunk. This function uses |lua53-lua_load| to load the
chunk in the file named filename. If filename is NULL, then it loads from the
standard input. The first line in the file is ignored if it starts with a #.
The string mode works as in function |lua53-lua_load|.
This function returns the same results as |lua53-lua_load|, but it has an
extra error code LUA_ERRFILE for file-related errors (e.g., it cannot open or
read the file).
As |lua53-lua_load|, this function only loads the chunk; it does not run it.

    int luaL_ref (lua_State *L, int t);

Creates and returns a reference, in the table at index t, for the object at
the top of the stack (and pops the object).
A reference is a unique integer key. As long as you do not manually add
integer keys into table t, |lua53-luaL_ref| ensures the uniqueness of the key
it returns. You can retrieve an object referred by reference r by calling
lua_rawgeti(L, t, r). Function |lua53-luaL_unref| frees a reference and its
associated object.
If the object at the top of the stack is nil, |lua53-luaL_ref| returns the
constant LUA_REFNIL. The constant LUA_NOREF is guaranteed to be different from
any reference returned by |lua53-luaL_ref|.

openf with string modname as an argument and sets the call result in

The standard representation for file handles, which is used by the standard
I/O library.
A file handle is implemented as a full userdata, with a metatable called
LUA_FILEHANDLE (where LUA_FILEHANDLE is a macro with the actual metatable's
name). The metatable is created by the I/O library (see
|lua53-luaL_newmetatable|).
This userdata must start with the structure luaL_Stream; it can contain other
data after this initial structure. Field f points to the corresponding C
stream (or it can be NULL to indicate an incompletely created handle). Field
closef points to a Lua function that will be called to close the stream when
the handle is closed or collected; this function receives the file handle as
its sole argument and must return either true (in case of success) or nil plus
an error message (in case of error). Once Lua calls this field, it changes the
field value to NULL to signal that the handle is closed.

Converts any Lua value at the given index to a C string in a reasonable
format. The resulting string is pushed onto the stack and also returned by the
function. If len is not NULL, the function also sets *len with the string
length.
If the value has a metatable with a __tostring field, then luaL_tolstring
calls the corresponding metamethod with the value as argument, and uses the
result of the call as its result.

The standard Lua libraries provide useful functions that are implemented
directly through the C API. Some of these functions provide essential services
to the language (e.g., |lua53-type| and |lua53-getmetatable|); others provide
access to "outside" services (e.g., I/O); and others could be implemented in
Lua itself, but are quite useful or have critical performance requirements
that deserve an implementation in C (e.g., |lua53-table.sort|).
All libraries are implemented through the official C API and are provided as
separate C modules. Currently, Lua has the following standard libraries:
- basic library (|lua53-sec6.1|);
- coroutine library (|lua53-sec6.2|);
- package library (|lua53-sec6.3|);
- string manipulation (|lua53-sec6.4|);
- basic UTF-8 support (|lua53-sec6.5|);
- table manipulation (|lua53-sec6.6|);
- mathematical functions (|lua53-sec6.7|) (sin, log, etc.);
- input and output (|lua53-sec6.8|);
- operating system facilities (|lua53-sec6.9|);
- debug facilities (|lua53-sec6.10|).
Except for the basic and the package libraries, each library provides all its
functions as fields of a global table or as methods of its objects.
To have access to these libraries, the C host program should call the
|lua53-luaL_openlibs| function, which opens all standard libraries.
Alternatively, the host program can open them individually by using
|lua53-luaL_requiref| to call luaopen_base (for the basic library),
luaopen_package (for the package library), luaopen_coroutine (for the
coroutine library), luaopen_string (for the string library), luaopen_utf8 (for
the UTF8 library), luaopen_table (for the table library), luaopen_math (for
the mathematical library), luaopen_io (for the I/O library), luaopen_os (for
the operating system library), and luaopen_debug (for the debug library).
These functions are declared in lualib.h.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.1  Basic Functions                                            *lua53-sec6.1*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The basic library provides core functions to Lua. If you do not include this
library in your application, you should check carefully whether you need to
provide implementations for some of its facilities.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                *lua53-assert*
assert (v [, message]) ~

Calls |lua53-error| if the value of its argument v is false (i.e., nil or
false); otherwise, returns all its arguments. In case of error, message is the
error object; when absent, it defaults to "assertion failed!"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                        *lua53-collectgarbage*
collectgarbage ([opt [, arg]]) ~

This function is a generic interface to the garbage collector. It performs
different functions according to its first argument, opt:
- "collect": performs a full garbage-collection cycle. This is the default
  option.
- "stop": stops automatic execution of the garbage collector. The collector
  will run only when explicitly invoked, until a call to restart it.
- "restart": restarts automatic execution of the garbage collector.
- "count": returns the total memory in use by Lua in Kbytes. The value has a
  fractional part, so that it multiplied by 1024 gives the exact number of
  bytes in use by Lua (except for overflows).
- "step": performs a garbage-collection step. The step "size" is controlled by
  arg. With a zero value, the collector will perform one basic (indivisible)
  step. For non-zero values, the collector will perform as if that amount of
  memory (in KBytes) had been allocated by Lua. Returns true if the step
  finished a collection cycle.
- "setpause": sets arg as the new value for the pause of the collector (see
  |lua53-sec2.5|). Returns the previous value for pause.
- "setstepmul": sets arg as the new value for the step multiplier of the
  collector (see |lua53-sec2.5|). Returns the previous value for step.
- "isrunning": returns a boolean that tells whether the collector is running
  (i.e., not stopped).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                *lua53-dofile*
dofile ([filename]) ~

Opens the named file and executes its contents as a Lua chunk. When called
without arguments, dofile executes the contents of the standard input (stdin).
Returns all values returned by the chunk. In case of errors, dofile propagates
the error to its caller (that is, dofile does not run in protected mode).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                 *lua53-error*
error (message [, level]) ~

Terminates the last protected function called and returns message as the error
object. Function error never returns.
Usually, error adds some information about the error position at the beginning
of the message, if the message is a string. The level argument specifies how
to get the error position. With level 1 (the default), the error position is
where the error function was called. Level 2 points the error to where the
function that called error was called; and so on. Passing a level 0 avoids the
addition of error position information to the message.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                    *lua53-_G*
_G ~

A global variable (not a function) that holds the global environment (see
|lua53-sec2.2|). Lua itself does not use this variable; changing its value
does not affect any environment, nor vice versa.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua53-getmetatable*
getmetatable (object) ~

If object does not have a metatable, returns nil. Otherwise, if the object's
metatable has a __metatable field, returns the associated value. Otherwise,
returns the metatable of the given object.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                *lua53-ipairs*
ipairs (t) ~

Returns three values (an iterator function, the table t, and 0) so that the
construction
>
     for i,v in ipairs(t) do body end
<
will iterate over the key-value pairs (1,t[1]), (2,t[2]), ..., up to the first
nil value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                  *lua53-load*
load (chunk [, chunkname [, mode [, env]]]) ~

Loads a chunk.
If chunk is a string, the chunk is this string. If chunk is a function, load
calls it repeatedly to get the chunk pieces. Each call to chunk must return a
string that concatenates with previous results. A return of an empty string,
nil, or no value signals the end of the chunk.
If there are no syntactic errors, returns the compiled chunk as a function;
otherwise, returns nil plus the error message.
If the resulting function has upvalues, the first upvalue is set to the value
of env, if that parameter is given, or to the value of the global environment.
Other upvalues are initialized with nil. (When you load a main chunk, the
resulting function will always have exactly one upvalue, the _ENV variable
(see |lua53-sec2.2|). However, when you load a binary chunk created from a
function (see |lua53-string.dump|), the resulting function can have an
arbitrary number of upvalues.) All upvalues are fresh, that is, they are not
shared with any other function.
chunkname is used as the name of the chunk for error messages and debug
information (see |lua53-sec4.9|). When absent, it defaults to chunk, if chunk
is a string, or to "=(load)" otherwise.
The string mode controls whether the chunk can be text or binary (that is, a
precompiled chunk). It may be the string "b" (only binary chunks), "t" (only
text chunks), or "bt" (both binary and text). The default is "bt".
Lua does not check the consistency of binary chunks. Maliciously crafted
binary chunks can crash the interpreter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua53-loadfile*
loadfile ([filename [, mode [, env]]]) ~

Similar to |lua53-load|, but gets the chunk from file filename or from the
standard input, if no file name is given.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                  *lua53-next*
next (table [, index]) ~

Allows a program to traverse all fields of a table. Its first argument is a
table and its second argument is an index in this table. next returns the next
index of the table and its associated value. When called with nil as its
second argument, next returns an initial index and its associated value. When
called with the last index, or with nil in an empty table, next returns nil.
If the second argument is absent, then it is interpreted as nil. In
particular, you can use next(t) to check whether a table is empty.
The order in which the indices are enumerated is not specified, even for
numeric indices. (To traverse a table in numerical order, use a numerical
for.)
The behavior of next is undefined if, during the traversal, you assign any
value to a non-existent field in the table. You may however modify existing
fields. In particular, you may clear existing fields.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                 *lua53-pairs*
pairs (t) ~

If t has a metamethod __pairs, calls it with t as argument and returns the
first three results from the call.
Otherwise, returns three values: the |lua53-next| function, the table t, and
nil, so that the construction
>
     for k,v in pairs(t) do body end
<
will iterate over all key-value pairs of table t.
See function |lua53-next| for the caveats of modifying the table during its
traversal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                 *lua53-pcall*
pcall (f [, arg1, ...]) ~

Calls function f with the given arguments in protected mode. This means that
any error inside f is not propagated; instead, pcall catches the error and
returns a status code. Its first result is the status code (a boolean), which
is true if the call succeeds without errors. In such case, pcall also returns
all results from the call, after this first result. In case of any error,
pcall returns false plus the error message.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                 *lua53-print*
print (...) ~

Receives any number of arguments and prints their values to stdout, using the
|lua53-tostring| function to convert each argument to a string. print is not
intended for formatted output, but only as a quick way to show a value, for
instance for debugging. For complete control over the output, use
|lua53-string.format| and |lua53-io.write|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua53-rawequal*
rawequal (v1, v2) ~

Checks whether v1 is equal to v2, without invoking the __eq metamethod.
Returns a boolean.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                *lua53-rawget*
rawget (table, index) ~

Gets the real value of table[index], without invoking the __index metamethod.
table must be a table; index may be any value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                *lua53-rawlen*
rawlen (v) ~

Returns the length of the object v, which must be a table or a string, without
invoking the __len metamethod. Returns an integer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                *lua53-rawset*
rawset (table, index, value) ~

Sets the real value of table[index] to value, without invoking the __newindex
metamethod. table must be a table, index any value different from nil and NaN,
and value any Lua value.
This function returns table.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                *lua53-select*
select (index, ...) ~

If index is a number, returns all arguments after argument number index; a
negative number indexes from the end (-1 is the last argument). Otherwise,
index must be the string "#", and select returns the total number of extra
arguments it received.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua53-setmetatable*
setmetatable (table, metatable) ~

Sets the metatable for the given table. (To change the metatable of other
types from Lua code, you must use the debug library (|lua53-sec6.10|).) If
metatable is nil, removes the metatable of the given table. If the original
metatable has a __metatable field, raises an error.
This function returns table.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua53-tonumber*
tonumber (e [, base]) ~

When called with no base, tonumber tries to convert its argument to a number.
If the argument is already a number or a string convertible to a number, then
tonumber returns this number; otherwise, it returns nil.
The conversion of strings can result in integers or floats, according to the
lexical conventions of Lua (see |lua53-sec3.1|). (The string may have leading
and trailing spaces and a sign.)
When called with base, then e must be a string to be interpreted as an integer
numeral in that base. The base may be any integer between 2 and 36, inclusive.
In bases above 10, the letter 'A' (in either upper or lower case) represents
10, 'B' represents 11, and so forth, with 'Z' representing 35. If the string e
is not a valid numeral in the given base, the function returns nil.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua53-tostring*
tostring (v) ~

Receives a value of any type and converts it to a string in a human-readable
format. (For complete control of how numbers are converted, use
|lua53-string.format|.)
If the metatable of v has a __tostring field, then tostring calls the
corresponding value with v as argument, and uses the result of the call as its
result.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                  *lua53-type*
type (v) ~

Returns the type of its only argument, coded as a string. The possible results
of this function are "nil" (a string, not the value nil), "number", "string",
"boolean", "table", "function", "thread", and "userdata".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua53-_VERSION*
_VERSION ~

A global variable (not a function) that holds a string containing the running
Lua version. The current value of this variable is "Lua 5.3".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                *lua53-xpcall*
xpcall (f, msgh [, arg1, ...]) ~

This function is similar to |lua53-pcall|, except that it sets a new message
handler msgh.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.2  Coroutine Manipulation                                     *lua53-sec6.2*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library comprises the operations to manipulate coroutines, which come
inside the table coroutine. See |lua53-sec2.6| for a general description of
coroutines.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                      *lua53-coroutine.create*
coroutine.create (f) ~

Creates a new coroutine, with body f. f must be a function. Returns this new
coroutine, an object with type "thread".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                 *lua53-coroutine.isyieldable*
coroutine.isyieldable () ~

Returns true when the running coroutine can yield.
A running coroutine is yieldable if it is not the main thread and it is not
inside a non-yieldable C function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                      *lua53-coroutine.resume*
coroutine.resume (co [, val1, ...]) ~

Starts or continues the execution of coroutine co. The first time you resume a
coroutine, it starts running its body. The values val1, ... are passed as the
arguments to the body function. If the coroutine has yielded, resume restarts
it; the values val1, ... are passed as the results from the yield.
If the coroutine runs without any errors, resume returns true plus any values
passed to yield (when the coroutine yields) or any values returned by the body
function (when the coroutine terminates). If there is any error, resume
returns false plus the error message.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                     *lua53-coroutine.running*
coroutine.running () ~

Returns the running coroutine plus a boolean, true when the running coroutine
is the main one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                      *lua53-coroutine.status*
coroutine.status (co) ~

Returns the status of coroutine co, as a string: "running", if the coroutine
is running (that is, it called status); "suspended", if the coroutine is
suspended in a call to yield, or if it has not started running yet; "normal"
if the coroutine is active but not running (that is, it has resumed another
coroutine); and "dead" if the coroutine has finished its body function, or if
it has stopped with an error.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                        *lua53-coroutine.wrap*
coroutine.wrap (f) ~

Creates a new coroutine, with body f. f must be a function. Returns a function
that resumes the coroutine each time it is called. Any arguments passed to the
function behave as the extra arguments to resume. Returns the same values
returned by resume, except the first boolean. In case of error, propagates the
error.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                       *lua53-coroutine.yield*
coroutine.yield (...) ~

Suspends the execution of the calling coroutine. Any arguments to yield are
passed as extra results to resume.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.3  Modules                                                    *lua53-sec6.3*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The package library provides basic facilities for loading modules in Lua. It
exports one function directly in the global environment: |lua53-require|.
Everything else is exported in a table package.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               *lua53-require*
require (modname) ~

Loads the given module. The function starts by looking into the
|lua53-package.loaded| table to determine whether modname is already loaded.
If it is, then require returns the value stored at package.loaded[modname].
Otherwise, it tries to find a loader for the module.
To find a loader, require is guided by the |lua53-package.searchers| sequence.
By changing this sequence, we can change how require looks for a module. The
following explanation is based on the default configuration for
|lua53-package.searchers|.
First require queries package.preload[modname]. If it has a value, this value
(which must be a function) is the loader. Otherwise require searches for a Lua
loader using the path stored in |lua53-package.path|. If that also fails, it
searches for a C loader using the path stored in |lua53-package.cpath|. If
that also fails, it tries an all-in-one loader (see
|lua53-package.searchers|).
Once a loader is found, require calls the loader with two arguments: modname
and an extra value dependent on how it got the loader. (If the loader came
from a file, this extra value is the file name.) If the loader returns any
non-nil value, require assigns the returned value to package.loaded[modname].
If the loader does not return a non-nil value and has not assigned any value
to package.loaded[modname], then require assigns true to this entry. In any
case, require returns the final value of package.loaded[modname].
If there is any error loading or running the module, or if it cannot find any
loader for the module, then require raises an error.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                        *lua53-package.config*
package.config ~

A string describing some compile-time configurations for packages. This string
is a sequence of lines:
- The first line is the directory separator string. Default is '\' for Windows
  and '/' for all other systems.
- The second line is the character that separates templates in a path. Default
  is ';'.
- The third line is the string that marks the substitution points in a
  template. Default is '?'.
- The fourth line is a string that, in a path in Windows, is replaced by the
  executable's directory. Default is '!'.
- The fifth line is a mark to ignore all text after it when building the
  luaopen_ function name. Default is '-'.

                                                         *lua53-LUA_CPATH_5_3*
                                                             *lua53-LUA_CPATH*
                                                         *lua53-package.cpath*
package.cpath ~

The path used by |lua53-require| to search for a C loader.
Lua initializes the C path |lua53-package.cpath| in the same way it
initializes the Lua path |lua53-package.path|, using the environment variable
LUA_CPATH_5_3, or the environment variable LUA_CPATH, or a default path
defined in luaconf.h.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                        *lua53-package.loaded*
package.loaded ~

A table used by |lua53-require| to control which modules are already loaded.
When you require a module modname and package.loaded[modname] is not false,
|lua53-require| simply returns the value stored there.
This variable is only a reference to the real table; assignments to this
variable do not change the table used by |lua53-require|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                       *lua53-package.loadlib*
package.loadlib (libname, funcname) ~

Dynamically links the host program with the C library libname.
If funcname is "*", then it only links with the library, making the symbols
exported by the library available to other dynamically linked libraries.
Otherwise, it looks for a function funcname inside the library and returns
this function as a C function. So, funcname must follow the
|lua53-lua_CFunction| prototype (see |lua53-lua_CFunction|).
This is a low-level function. It completely bypasses the package and module
system. Unlike |lua53-require|, it does not perform any path searching and
does not automatically adds extensions. libname must be the complete file name
of the C library, including if necessary a path and an extension. funcname
must be the exact name exported by the C library (which may depend on the C
compiler and linker used).
This function is not supported by Standard C. As such, it is only available on
some platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, BSD, plus other Unix
systems that support the dlfcn standard).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua53-LUA_PATH_5_3*
                                                              *lua53-LUA_PATH*
                                                          *lua53-package.path*
package.path ~

The path used by |lua53-require| to search for a Lua loader.
At start-up, Lua initializes this variable with the value of the environment
variable LUA_PATH_5_3 or the environment variable LUA_PATH or with a default
path defined in luaconf.h, if those environment variables are not defined. Any
";;" in the value of the environment variable is replaced by the default path.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                       *lua53-package.preload*
package.preload ~

A table to store loaders for specific modules (see |lua53-require|).
This variable is only a reference to the real table; assignments to this
variable do not change the table used by |lua53-require|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                     *lua53-package.searchers*
package.searchers ~

A table used by |lua53-require| to control how to load modules.
Each entry in this table is a searcher function. When looking for a module,
|lua53-require| calls each of these searchers in ascending order, with the
module name (the argument given to |lua53-require|) as its sole parameter. The
function can return another function (the module loader) plus an extra value
that will be passed to that loader, or a string explaining why it did not find
that module (or nil if it has nothing to say).
Lua initializes this table with four searcher functions.
The first searcher simply looks for a loader in the |lua53-package.preload|
table.
The second searcher looks for a loader as a Lua library, using the path stored
at |lua53-package.path|. The search is done as described in function
|lua53-package.searchpath|.
The third searcher looks for a loader as a C library, using the path given by
the variable |lua53-package.cpath|. Again, the search is done as described in
function |lua53-package.searchpath|. For instance, if the C path is the string
>
     "./?.so;./?.dll;/usr/local/?/init.so"
<
the searcher for module foo will try to open the files ./foo.so, ./foo.dll,
and /usr/local/foo/init.so, in that order. Once it finds a C library, this
searcher first uses a dynamic link facility to link the application with the
library. Then it tries to find a C function inside the library to be used as
the loader. The name of this C function is the string "luaopen_" concatenated
with a copy of the module name where each dot is replaced by an underscore.
Moreover, if the module name has a hyphen, its suffix after (and including)
the first hyphen is removed. For instance, if the module name is a.b.c-v2.1,
the function name will be luaopen_a_b_c.
The fourth searcher tries an all-in-one loader. It searches the C path for a
library for the root name of the given module. For instance, when requiring
a.b.c, it will search for a C library for a. If found, it looks into it for an
open function for the submodule; in our example, that would be luaopen_a_b_c.
With this facility, a package can pack several C submodules into one single
library, with each submodule keeping its original open function.
All searchers except the first one (preload) return as the extra value the
file name where the module was found, as returned by
|lua53-package.searchpath|. The first searcher returns no extra value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                    *lua53-package.searchpath*
package.searchpath (name, path [, sep [, rep]]) ~

Searches for the given name in the given path.
A path is a string containing a sequence of templates separated by semicolons.
For each template, the function replaces each interrogation mark (if any) in
the template with a copy of name wherein all occurrences of sep (a dot, by
default) were replaced by rep (the system's directory separator, by default),
and then tries to open the resulting file name.
For instance, if the path is the string
>
     "./?.lua;./?.lc;/usr/local/?/init.lua"
<
the search for the name foo.a will try to open the files ./foo/a.lua,
./foo/a.lc, and /usr/local/foo/a/init.lua, in that order.
Returns the resulting name of the first file that it can open in read mode
(after closing the file), or nil plus an error message if none succeeds. (This
error message lists all file names it tried to open.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.4  String Manipulation                                        *lua53-sec6.4*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library provides generic functions for string manipulation, such as
finding and extracting substrings, and pattern matching. When indexing a
string in Lua, the first character is at position 1 (not at 0, as in C).
Indices are allowed to be negative and are interpreted as indexing backwards,
from the end of the string. Thus, the last character is at position -1, and so
on.
The string library provides all its functions inside the table string. It also
sets a metatable for strings where the __index field points to the string
table. Therefore, you can use the string functions in object-oriented style.
For instance, string.byte(s,i) can be written as s:byte(i).
The string library assumes one-byte character encodings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *lua53-string.byte*
string.byte (s [, i [, j]]) ~

Returns the internal numeric codes of the characters s[i], s[i+1], ..., s[j].
The default value for i is 1; the default value for j is i. These indices are
corrected following the same rules of function |lua53-string.sub|.
Numeric codes are not necessarily portable across platforms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *lua53-string.char*
string.char (...) ~

Receives zero or more integers. Returns a string with length equal to the
number of arguments, in which each character has the internal numeric code
equal to its corresponding argument.
Numeric codes are not necessarily portable across platforms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *lua53-string.dump*
string.dump (function [, strip]) ~

Returns a string containing a binary representation (a binary chunk) of the
given function, so that a later |lua53-load| on this string returns a copy of
the function (but with new upvalues). If strip is a true value, the binary
representation may not include all debug information about the function, to
save space.
Functions with upvalues have only their number of upvalues saved. When
(re)loaded, those upvalues receive fresh instances containing nil. (You can
use the debug library to serialize and reload the upvalues of a function in a
way adequate to your needs.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *lua53-string.find*
string.find (s, pattern [, init [, plain]]) ~

Looks for the first match of pattern (see |lua53-sec6.4.1|) in the string s.
If it finds a match, then find returns the indices of s where this occurrence
starts and ends; otherwise, it returns nil. A third, optional numeric argument
init specifies where to start the search; its default value is 1 and can be
negative. A value of true as a fourth, optional argument plain turns off the
pattern matching facilities, so the function does a plain "find substring"
operation, with no characters in pattern being considered magic. Note that if
plain is given, then init must be given as well.
If the pattern has captures, then in a successful match the captured values
are also returned, after the two indices.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                         *lua53-string.format*
string.format (formatstring, ...) ~

Returns a formatted version of its variable number of arguments following the
description given in its first argument (which must be a string). The format
string follows the same rules as the ISO C function sprintf. The only
differences are that the options/modifiers *, h, L, l, n, and p are not
supported and that there is an extra option, q.
The q option formats a string between double quotes, using escape sequences
when necessary to ensure that it can safely be read back by the Lua
interpreter. For instance, the call
>
     string.format('%q', 'a string with "quotes" and \n new line')
<
may produce the string:
>
     "a string with \"quotes\" and \
      new line"
<
Options A, a, E, e, f, G, and g all expect a number as argument. Options c, d,
i, o, u, X, and x expect an integer. When Lua is compiled with a C89 compiler,
options A and a (hexadecimal floats) do not support any modifier (flags,
width, length).
Option s expects a string; if its argument is not a string, it is converted to
one following the same rules of |lua53-tostring|. If the option has any
modifier (flags, width, length), the string argument should not contain
embedded zeros.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                         *lua53-string.gmatch*
string.gmatch (s, pattern) ~

Returns an iterator function that, each time it is called, returns the next
captures from pattern (see |lua53-sec6.4.1|) over the string s. If pattern
specifies no captures, then the whole match is produced in each call.
As an example, the following loop will iterate over all the words from string
s, printing one per line:
>
     s = "hello world from Lua"
     for w in string.gmatch(s, "%a+") do
       print(w)
     end
<
The next example collects all pairs key=value from the given string into a
table:
>
     t = {}
     s = "from=world, to=Lua"
     for k, v in string.gmatch(s, "(%w+)=(%w+)") do
       t[k] = v
     end
<
For this function, a caret '^' at the start of a pattern does not work as an
anchor, as this would prevent the iteration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *lua53-string.gsub*
string.gsub (s, pattern, repl [, n]) ~

Returns a copy of s in which all (or the first n, if given) occurrences of the
pattern (see |lua53-sec6.4.1|) have been replaced by a replacement string
specified by repl, which can be a string, a table, or a function. gsub also
returns, as its second value, the total number of matches that occurred. The
name gsub comes from Global SUBstitution.
If repl is a string, then its value is used for replacement. The character %
works as an escape character: any sequence in repl of the form %d, with d
between 1 and 9, stands for the value of the d-th captured substring. The
sequence %0 stands for the whole match. The sequence %% stands for a single %.
If repl is a table, then the table is queried for every match, using the first
capture as the key.
If repl is a function, then this function is called every time a match occurs,
with all captured substrings passed as arguments, in order.
In any case, if the pattern specifies no captures, then it behaves as if the
whole pattern was inside a capture.
If the value returned by the table query or by the function call is a string
or a number, then it is used as the replacement string; otherwise, if it is
false or nil, then there is no replacement (that is, the original match is
kept in the string).
Here are some examples:
>
     x = string.gsub("hello world", "(%w+)", "%1 %1")
     --> x="hello hello world world"
     
     x = string.gsub("hello world", "%w+", "%0 %0", 1)
     --> x="hello hello world"
     
     x = string.gsub("hello world from Lua", "(%w+)%s*(%w+)", "%2 %1")
     --> x="world hello Lua from"
     
     x = string.gsub("home = $HOME, user = $USER", "%$(%w+)", os.getenv)
     --> x="home = /home/roberto, user = roberto"
     
     x = string.gsub("4+5 = $return 4+5$", "%$(.-)%$", function (s)
           return load(s)()
         end)
     --> x="4+5 = 9"
     
     local t = {name="lua", version="5.3"}
     x = string.gsub("$name-$version.tar.gz", "%$(%w+)", t)
     --> x="lua-5.3.tar.gz"
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua53-string.len*
string.len (s) ~

Receives a string and returns its length. The empty string "" has length 0.
Embedded zeros are counted, so "a\000bc\000" has length 5.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua53-string.lower*
string.lower (s) ~

Receives a string and returns a copy of this string with all uppercase letters
changed to lowercase. All other characters are left unchanged. The definition
of what an uppercase letter is depends on the current locale.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua53-string.match*
string.match (s, pattern [, init]) ~

Looks for the first match of pattern (see |lua53-sec6.4.1|) in the string s.
If it finds one, then match returns the captures from the pattern; otherwise
it returns nil. If pattern specifies no captures, then the whole match is
returned. A third, optional numeric argument init specifies where to start the
search; its default value is 1 and can be negative.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *lua53-string.pack*
string.pack (fmt, v1, v2, ...) ~

Returns a binary string containing the values v1, v2, etc. packed (that is,
serialized in binary form) according to the format string fmt (see
|lua53-sec6.4.2|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                       *lua53-string.packsize*
string.packsize (fmt) ~

Returns the size of a string resulting from |lua53-string.pack| with the given
format. The format string cannot have the variable-length options 's' or 'z'
(see |lua53-sec6.4.2|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua53-string.rep*
string.rep (s, n [, sep]) ~

Returns a string that is the concatenation of n copies of the string s
separated by the string sep. The default value for sep is the empty string
(that is, no separator). Returns the empty string if n is not positive.
(Note that it is very easy to exhaust the memory of your machine with a single
call to this function.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                        *lua53-string.reverse*
string.reverse (s) ~

Returns a string that is the string s reversed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua53-string.sub*
string.sub (s, i [, j]) ~

Returns the substring of s that starts at i and continues until j; i and j can
be negative. If j is absent, then it is assumed to be equal to -1 (which is
the same as the string length). In particular, the call string.sub(s,1,j)
returns a prefix of s with length j, and string.sub(s, -i) (for a positive i)
returns a suffix of s with length i.
If, after the translation of negative indices, i is less than 1, it is
corrected to 1. If j is greater than the string length, it is corrected to
that length. If, after these corrections, i is greater than j, the function
returns the empty string.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                         *lua53-string.unpack*
string.unpack (fmt, s [, pos]) ~

Returns the values packed in string s (see |lua53-string.pack|) according to
the format string fmt (see |lua53-sec6.4.2|). An optional pos marks where to
start reading in s (default is 1). After the read values, this function also
returns the index of the first unread byte in s.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua53-string.upper*
string.upper (s) ~

Receives a string and returns a copy of this string with all lowercase letters
changed to uppercase. All other characters are left unchanged. The definition
of what a lowercase letter is depends on the current locale.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.4.1  Patterns                                               *lua53-sec6.4.1*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patterns in Lua are described by regular strings, which are interpreted as
patterns by the pattern-matching functions |lua53-string.find|,
|lua53-string.gmatch|, |lua53-string.gsub|, and |lua53-string.match|. This
section describes the syntax and the meaning (that is, what they match) of
these strings.
Character Class:
A character class is used to represent a set of characters. The following
combinations are allowed in describing a character class:
- x: (where x is not one of the magic characters ^$()%.[]*+-?) represents the
  character x itself.
- .: (a dot) represents all characters.
- %a: represents all letters.
- %c: represents all control characters.
- %d: represents all digits.
- %g: represents all printable characters except space.
- %l: represents all lowercase letters.
- %p: represents all punctuation characters.
- %s: represents all space characters.
- %u: represents all uppercase letters.
- %w: represents all alphanumeric characters.
- %x: represents all hexadecimal digits.
- %x: (where x is any non-alphanumeric character) represents the character x.
  This is the standard way to escape the magic characters. Any
  non-alphanumeric character (including all punctuation characters, even the
  non-magical) can be preceded by a '%' when used to represent itself in a
  pattern.
- [set]: represents the class which is the union of all characters in set. A
  range of characters can be specified by separating the end characters of the
  range, in ascending order, with a '-'. All classes %x described above can
  also be used as components in set. All other characters in set represent
  themselves. For example, [%w_] (or [_%w]) represents all alphanumeric
  characters plus the underscore, [0-7] represents the octal digits, and
  [0-7%l%-] represents the octal digits plus the lowercase letters plus the
  '-' character.
  You can put a closing square bracket in a set by positioning it as the first
  character in the set. You can put an hyphen in a set by positioning it as
  the first or the last character in the set. (You can also use an escape for
  both cases.)
  The interaction between ranges and classes is not defined. Therefore,
  patterns like [%a-z] or [a-%%] have no meaning.
- [^set]: represents the complement of set, where set is interpreted as above.
For all classes represented by single letters (%a, %c, etc.), the
corresponding uppercase letter represents the complement of the class. For
instance, %S represents all non-space characters.
The definitions of letter, space, and other character groups depend on the
current locale. In particular, the class [a-z] may not be equivalent to %l.
Pattern Item:
A pattern item can be
- a single character class, which matches any single character in the class;
- a single character class followed by '*', which matches zero or more
  repetitions of characters in the class. These repetition items will always
  match the longest possible sequence;
- a single character class followed by '+', which matches one or more
  repetitions of characters in the class. These repetition items will always
  match the longest possible sequence;
- a single character class followed by '-', which also matches zero or more
  repetitions of characters in the class. Unlike '*', these repetition items
  will always match the shortest possible sequence;
- a single character class followed by '?', which matches zero or one
  occurrence of a character in the class. It always matches one occurrence if
  possible;
- %n, for n between 1 and 9; such item matches a substring equal to the n-th
  captured string (see below);
- %bxy, where x and y are two distinct characters; such item matches strings
  that start with x, end with y, and where the x and y are balanced. This
  means that, if one reads the string from left to right, counting +1 for an x
  and -1 for a y, the ending y is the first y where the count reaches 0. For
  instance, the item %b() matches expressions with balanced parentheses.
- %f[set], a frontier pattern; such item matches an empty string at any
  position such that the next character belongs to set and the previous
  character does not belong to set. The set set is interpreted as previously
  described. The beginning and the end of the subject are handled as if they
  were the character '\0'.
Pattern:
A pattern is a sequence of pattern items. A caret '^' at the beginning of a
pattern anchors the match at the beginning of the subject string. A '$' at the
end of a pattern anchors the match at the end of the subject string. At other
positions, '^' and '$' have no special meaning and represent themselves.
Captures:
A pattern can contain sub-patterns enclosed in parentheses; they describe
captures. When a match succeeds, the substrings of the subject string that
match captures are stored (captured) for future use. Captures are numbered
according to their left parentheses. For instance, in the pattern
"(a*(.)%w(%s*))", the part of the string matching "a*(.)%w(%s*)" is stored as
the first capture (and therefore has number 1); the character matching "." is
captured with number 2, and the part matching "%s*" has number 3.
As a special case, the empty capture () captures the current string position
(a number). For instance, if we apply the pattern "()aa()" on the string
"flaaap", there will be two captures: 3 and 5.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.4.2  Format Strings for Pack and Unpack                     *lua53-sec6.4.2*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first argument to |lua53-string.pack|, |lua53-string.packsize|, and
|lua53-string.unpack| is a format string, which describes the layout of the
structure being created or read.
A format string is a sequence of conversion options. The conversion options
are as follows:
- <:sets little endian
- >:sets big endian
- =:sets native endian
- ![n]:sets maximum alignment to n (default is native alignment)

(A "[n]" means an optional integral numeral.) Except for padding, spaces, and
configurations (options "xX <=>!"), each option corresponds to an argument (in
|lua53-string.pack|) or a result (in |lua53-string.unpack|).
For options "!n", "sn", "in", and "In", n can be any integer between 1 and 16.
All integral options check overflows; |lua53-string.pack| checks whether the
given value fits in the given size; |lua53-string.unpack| checks whether the
read value fits in a Lua integer.
Any format string starts as if prefixed by "!1=", that is, with maximum
alignment of 1 (no alignment) and native endianness.
Alignment works as follows: For each option, the format gets extra padding
until the data starts at an offset that is a multiple of the minimum between
the option size and the maximum alignment; this minimum must be a power of 2.
Options "c" and "z" are not aligned; option "s" follows the alignment of its
starting integer.
All padding is filled with zeros by |lua53-string.pack| (and ignored by
|lua53-string.unpack|).

6.5  UTF                                                        *lua53-sec6.5*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library provides basic support for UTF-8 encoding. It provides all its
functions inside the table utf8. This library does not provide any support for
Unicode other than the handling of the encoding. Any operation that needs the
meaning of a character, such as character classification, is outside its
scope.
Unless stated otherwise, all functions that expect a byte position as a
parameter assume that the given position is either the start of a byte
sequence or one plus the length of the subject string. As in the string
library, negative indices count from the end of the string.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua53-utf8.char*
utf8.char (...) ~

Receives zero or more integers, converts each one to its corresponding UTF-8
byte sequence and returns a string with the concatenation of all these
sequences.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                      *lua53-utf8.charpattern*
utf8.charpattern ~

The pattern (a string, not a function) "[\0-\x7F\xC2-\xF4][\x80-\xBF]*" (see
|lua53-sec6.4.1|), which matches exactly one UTF-8 byte sequence, assuming
that the subject is a valid UTF-8 string.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua53-utf8.codes*
utf8.codes (s) ~

Returns values so that the construction
>
     for p, c in utf8.codes(s) do body end
<
will iterate over all characters in string s, with p being the position (in
bytes) and c the code point of each character. It raises an error if it meets
any invalid byte sequence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                        *lua53-utf8.codepoint*
utf8.codepoint (s [, i [, j]]) ~

Returns the codepoints (as integers) from all characters in s that start
between byte position i and j (both included). The default for i is 1 and for
j is i. It raises an error if it meets any invalid byte sequence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua53-utf8.len*
utf8.len (s [, i [, j]]) ~

Returns the number of UTF-8 characters in string s that start between
positions i and j (both inclusive). The default for i is 1 and for j is -1. If
it finds any invalid byte sequence, returns a false value plus the position of
the first invalid byte.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *lua53-utf8.offset*
utf8.offset (s, n [, i]) ~

Returns the position (in bytes) where the encoding of the n-th character of s
(counting from position i) starts. A negative n gets characters before
position i. The default for i is 1 when n is non-negative and #s + 1
otherwise, so that utf8.offset(s, -n) gets the offset of the n-th character
from the end of the string. If the specified character is neither in the
subject nor right after its end, the function returns nil.
As a special case, when n is 0 the function returns the start of the encoding
of the character that contains the i-th byte of s.
This function assumes that s is a valid UTF-8 string.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.6  Table Manipulation                                         *lua53-sec6.6*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library provides generic functions for table manipulation. It provides
all its functions inside the table table.
Remember that, whenever an operation needs the length of a table, all caveats
about the length operator apply (see |lua53-sec3.4.7|). All functions ignore
non-numeric keys in the tables given as arguments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua53-table.concat*
table.concat (list [, sep [, i [, j]]]) ~

Given a list where all elements are strings or numbers, returns the string
list[i]..sep..list[i+1] ... sep..list[j]. The default value for sep is the
empty string, the default for i is 1, and the default for j is #list. If i is
greater than j, returns the empty string.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua53-table.insert*
table.insert (list, [pos,] value) ~

Inserts element value at position pos in list, shifting up the elements
list[pos], list[pos+1], ..., list[#list]. The default value for pos is
#list+1, so that a call table.insert(t,x) inserts x at the end of list t.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua53-table.move*
table.move (a1, f, e, t [,a2]) ~

Moves elements from table a1 to table a2, performing the equivalent to the
following multiple assignment: a2[t],... = a1[f],...,a1[e]. The default for a2
is a1. The destination range can overlap with the source range. The number of
elements to be moved must fit in a Lua integer.
Returns the destination table a2.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua53-table.pack*
table.pack (...) ~

Returns a new table with all parameters stored into keys 1, 2, etc. and with a
field "n" with the total number of parameters. Note that the resulting table
may not be a sequence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua53-table.remove*
table.remove (list [, pos]) ~

Removes from list the element at position pos, returning the value of the
removed element. When pos is an integer between 1 and #list, it shifts down
the elements list[pos+1], list[pos+2], ..., list[#list] and erases element
list[#list]; The index pos can also be 0 when #list is 0, or #list + 1; in
those cases, the function erases the element list[pos].
The default value for pos is #list, so that a call table.remove(l) removes the
last element of list l.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua53-table.sort*
table.sort (list [, comp]) ~

Sorts list elements in a given order, in-place, from list[1] to list[#list].
If comp is given, then it must be a function that receives two list elements
and returns true when the first element must come before the second in the
final order (so that, after the sort, i < j implies not
comp(list[j],list[i])). If comp is not given, then the standard Lua operator <
is used instead.
Note that the comp function must define a strict partial order over the
elements in the list; that is, it must be asymmetric and transitive.
Otherwise, no valid sort may be possible.
The sort algorithm is not stable: elements considered equal by the given order
may have their relative positions changed by the sort.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua53-table.unpack*
table.unpack (list [, i [, j]]) ~

Returns the elements from the given list. This function is equivalent to
>
     return list[i], list[i+1], ..., list[j]
<
By default, i is 1 and j is #list.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.7  Mathematical Functions                                     *lua53-sec6.7*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library provides basic mathematical functions. It provides all its
functions and constants inside the table math. Functions with the annotation
"integer/float" give integer results for integer arguments and float results
for float (or mixed) arguments. Rounding functions (|lua53-math.ceil|,
|lua53-math.floor|, and |lua53-math.modf|) return an integer when the result
fits in the range of an integer, or a float otherwise.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua53-math.abs*
math.abs (x) ~

Returns the absolute value of x. (integer/float)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua53-math.acos*
math.acos (x) ~

Returns the arc cosine of x (in radians).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua53-math.asin*
math.asin (x) ~

Returns the arc sine of x (in radians).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua53-math.atan*
math.atan (y [, x]) ~

Returns the arc tangent of y/x (in radians), but uses the signs of both
parameters to find the quadrant of the result. (It also handles correctly the
case of x being zero.)
The default value for x is 1, so that the call math.atan(y) returns the arc
tangent of y.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua53-math.ceil*
math.ceil (x) ~

Returns the smallest integral value larger than or equal to x.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua53-math.cos*
math.cos (x) ~

Returns the cosine of x (assumed to be in radians).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua53-math.deg*
math.deg (x) ~

Converts the angle x from radians to degrees.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua53-math.exp*
math.exp (x) ~

Returns the value ex (where e is the base of natural logarithms).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua53-math.floor*
math.floor (x) ~

Returns the largest integral value smaller than or equal to x.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua53-math.fmod*
math.fmod (x, y) ~

Returns the remainder of the division of x by y that rounds the quotient
towards zero. (integer/float)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua53-math.huge*
math.huge ~

The float value HUGE_VAL, a value larger than any other numeric value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua53-math.log*
math.log (x [, base]) ~

Returns the logarithm of x in the given base. The default for base is e (so
that the function returns the natural logarithm of x).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua53-math.max*
math.max (x, ...) ~

Returns the argument with the maximum value, according to the Lua operator <.
(integer/float)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                       *lua53-math.maxinteger*
math.maxinteger ~

An integer with the maximum value for an integer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua53-math.min*
math.min (x, ...) ~

Returns the argument with the minimum value, according to the Lua operator <.
(integer/float)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                       *lua53-math.mininteger*
math.mininteger ~

An integer with the minimum value for an integer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua53-math.modf*
math.modf (x) ~

Returns the integral part of x and the fractional part of x. Its second result
is always a float.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               *lua53-math.pi*
math.pi ~

The value of pi.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua53-math.rad*
math.rad (x) ~

Converts the angle x from degrees to radians.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *lua53-math.random*
math.random ([m [, n]]) ~

When called without arguments, returns a pseudo-random float with uniform
distribution in the range [0,1). When called with two integers m and n,
math.random returns a pseudo-random integer with uniform distribution in the
range [m, n]. (The value n-m cannot be negative and must fit in a Lua
integer.) The call math.random(n) is equivalent to math.random(1,n).
This function is an interface to the underling pseudo-random generator
function provided by C.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                       *lua53-math.randomseed*
math.randomseed (x) ~

Sets x as the "seed" for the pseudo-random generator: equal seeds produce
equal sequences of numbers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua53-math.sin*
math.sin (x) ~

Returns the sine of x (assumed to be in radians).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua53-math.sqrt*
math.sqrt (x) ~

Returns the square root of x. (You can also use the expression x^0.5 to
compute this value.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua53-math.tan*
math.tan (x) ~

Returns the tangent of x (assumed to be in radians).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                        *lua53-math.tointeger*
math.tointeger (x) ~

If the value x is convertible to an integer, returns that integer. Otherwise,
returns nil.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua53-math.type*
math.type (x) ~

Returns "integer" if x is an integer, "float" if it is a float, or nil if x is
not a number.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua53-math.ult*
math.ult (m, n) ~

Returns a boolean, true if and only if integer m is below integer n when they
are compared as unsigned integers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.8  Input and Output Facilities                                *lua53-sec6.8*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              *lua53-io.stdin*
                                                             *lua53-io.stdout*
                                                             *lua53-io.stderr*

The I/O library provides two different styles for file manipulation. The first
one uses implicit file handles; that is, there are operations to set a default
input file and a default output file, and all input/output operations are over
these default files. The second style uses explicit file handles.
When using implicit file handles, all operations are supplied by table io.
When using explicit file handles, the operation |lua53-io.open| returns a file
handle and then all operations are supplied as methods of the file handle.
The table io also provides three predefined file handles with their usual
meanings from C: io.stdin, io.stdout, and io.stderr. The I/O library never
closes these files.
Unless otherwise stated, all I/O functions return nil on failure (plus an
error message as a second result and a system-dependent error code as a third
result) and some value different from nil on success. On non-POSIX systems,
the computation of the error message and error code in case of errors may be
not thread safe, because they rely on the global C variable errno.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua53-io.close*
io.close ([file]) ~

Equivalent to file:close(). Without a file, closes the default output file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua53-io.flush*
io.flush () ~

Equivalent to io.output():flush().

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua53-io.input*
io.input ([file]) ~

When called with a file name, it opens the named file (in text mode), and sets
its handle as the default input file. When called with a file handle, it
simply sets this file handle as the default input file. When called without
parameters, it returns the current default input file.
In case of errors this function raises the error, instead of returning an
error code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua53-io.lines*
io.lines ([filename, ...]) ~

Opens the given file name in read mode and returns an iterator function that
works like file:lines(...) over the opened file. When the iterator function
detects the end of file, it returns no values (to finish the loop) and
automatically closes the file.
The call io.lines() (with no file name) is equivalent to
io.input():lines("*l"); that is, it iterates over the lines of the default
input file. In this case it does not close the file when the loop ends.
In case of errors this function raises the error, instead of returning an
error code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               *lua53-io.open*
io.open (filename [, mode]) ~

This function opens a file, in the mode specified in the string mode. In case
of success, it returns a new file handle.
The mode string can be any of the following:
- "r": read mode (the default);
- "w": write mode;
- "a": append mode;
- "r+": update mode, all previous data is preserved;
- "w+": update mode, all previous data is erased;
- "a+": append update mode, previous data is preserved, writing is only
  allowed at the end of file.
The mode string can also have a 'b' at the end, which is needed in some
systems to open the file in binary mode.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua53-io.output*
io.output ([file]) ~

Similar to |lua53-io.input|, but operates over the default output file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua53-io.popen*
io.popen (prog [, mode]) ~

This function is system dependent and is not available on all platforms.
Starts program prog in a separated process and returns a file handle that you
can use to read data from this program (if mode is "r", the default) or to
write data to this program (if mode is "w").

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               *lua53-io.read*
io.read (...) ~

Equivalent to io.input():read(...).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua53-io.tmpfile*
io.tmpfile () ~

In case of success, returns a handle for a temporary file. This file is opened
in update mode and it is automatically removed when the program ends.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               *lua53-io.type*
io.type (obj) ~

Checks whether obj is a valid file handle. Returns the string "file" if obj is
an open file handle, "closed file" if obj is a closed file handle, or nil if
obj is not a file handle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua53-io.write*
io.write (...) ~

Equivalent to io.output():write(...).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua53-file:close*
file:close () ~

Closes file. Note that files are automatically closed when their handles are
garbage collected, but that takes an unpredictable amount of time to happen.
When closing a file handle created with |lua53-io.popen|, |lua53-file:close|
returns the same values returned by |lua53-os.execute|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua53-file:flush*
file:flush () ~

Saves any written data to file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua53-file:lines*
file:lines (...) ~

Returns an iterator function that, each time it is called, reads the file
according to the given formats. When no format is given, uses "l" as a
default. As an example, the construction
>
     for c in file:lines(1) do body end
<
will iterate over all characters of the file, starting at the current
position. Unlike |lua53-io.lines|, this function does not close the file when
the loop ends.
In case of errors this function raises the error, instead of returning an
error code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua53-file:read*
file:read (...) ~

Reads the file file, according to the given formats, which specify what to
read. For each format, the function returns a string or a number with the
characters read, or nil if it cannot read data with the specified format. (In
this latter case, the function does not read subsequent formats.) When called
without formats, it uses a default format that reads the next line (see
below).
The available formats are
- "n": reads a numeral and returns it as a float or an integer, following the
  lexical conventions of Lua. (The numeral may have leading spaces and a
  sign.) This format always reads the longest input sequence that is a valid
  prefix for a numeral; if that prefix does not form a valid numeral (e.g., an
  empty string, "0x", or "3.4e-"), it is discarded and the function returns
  nil.
- "a": reads the whole file, starting at the current position. On end of file,
  it returns the empty string.
- "l": reads the next line skipping the end of line, returning nil on end of
  file. This is the default format.
- "L": reads the next line keeping the end-of-line character (if present),
  returning nil on end of file.
- number: reads a string with up to this number of bytes, returning nil on end
  of file. If number is zero, it reads nothing and returns an empty string, or
  nil on end of file.
The formats "l" and "L" should be used only for text files.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua53-file:seek*
file:seek ([whence [, offset]]) ~

Sets and gets the file position, measured from the beginning of the file, to
the position given by offset plus a base specified by the string whence, as
follows:
- "set": base is position 0 (beginning of the file);
- "cur": base is current position;
- "end": base is end of file;
In case of success, seek returns the final file position, measured in bytes
from the beginning of the file. If seek fails, it returns nil, plus a string
describing the error.
The default value for whence is "cur", and for offset is 0. Therefore, the
call file:seek() returns the current file position, without changing it; the
call file:seek("set") sets the position to the beginning of the file (and
returns 0); and the call file:seek("end") sets the position to the end of the
file, and returns its size.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua53-file:setvbuf*
file:setvbuf (mode [, size]) ~

Sets the buffering mode for an output file. There are three available modes:
- "no": no buffering; the result of any output operation appears immediately.
- "full": full buffering; output operation is performed only when the buffer
  is full or when you explicitly flush the file (see |lua53-io.flush|).
- "line": line buffering; output is buffered until a newline is output or
  there is any input from some special files (such as a terminal device).
For the last two cases, size specifies the size of the buffer, in bytes. The
default is an appropriate size.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua53-file:write*
file:write (...) ~

Writes the value of each of its arguments to file. The arguments must be
strings or numbers.
In case of success, this function returns file. Otherwise it returns nil plus
a string describing the error.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.9  Operating System Facilities                                *lua53-sec6.9*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library is implemented through table os.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              *lua53-os.clock*
os.clock () ~

Returns an approximation of the amount in seconds of CPU time used by the
program.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               *lua53-os.date*
os.date ([format [, time]]) ~

Returns a string or a table containing date and time, formatted according to
the given string format.
If the time argument is present, this is the time to be formatted (see the
|lua53-os.time| function for a description of this value). Otherwise, date
formats the current time.
If format starts with '!', then the date is formatted in Coordinated Universal
Time. After this optional character, if format is the string "*t", then date
returns a table with the following fields: year, month (1-12), day (1-31),
hour (0-23), min (0-59), sec (0-61), wday (weekday, 1-7, Sunday is 1), yday
(day of the year, 1-366), and isdst (daylight saving flag, a boolean). This
last field may be absent if the information is not available.
If format is not "*t", then date returns the date as a string, formatted
according to the same rules as the ISO C function strftime.
When called without arguments, date returns a reasonable date and time
representation that depends on the host system and on the current locale.
(More specifically, os.date() is equivalent to os.date("%c").)
On non-POSIX systems, this function may be not thread safe because of its
reliance on C function gmtime and C function localtime.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *lua53-os.difftime*
os.difftime (t2, t1) ~

Returns the difference, in seconds, from time t1 to time t2 (where the times
are values returned by |lua53-os.time|). In POSIX, Windows, and some other
systems, this value is exactly t2-t1.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua53-os.execute*
os.execute ([command]) ~

This function is equivalent to the ISO C function system. It passes command to
be executed by an operating system shell. Its first result is true if the
command terminated successfully, or nil otherwise. After this first result the
function returns a string plus a number, as follows:
- "exit": the command terminated normally; the following number is the exit
  status of the command.
- "signal": the command was terminated by a signal; the following number is
  the signal that terminated the command.
When called without a command, os.execute returns a boolean that is true if a
shell is available.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               *lua53-os.exit*
os.exit ([code [, close]]) ~

Calls the ISO C function exit to terminate the host program. If code is true,
the returned status is EXIT_SUCCESS; if code is false, the returned status is
EXIT_FAILURE; if code is a number, the returned status is this number. The
default value for code is true.
If the optional second argument close is true, closes the Lua state before
exiting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua53-os.getenv*
os.getenv (varname) ~

Returns the value of the process environment variable varname, or nil if the
variable is not defined.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua53-os.remove*
os.remove (filename) ~

Deletes the file (or empty directory, on POSIX systems) with the given name.
If this function fails, it returns nil, plus a string describing the error and
the error code. Otherwise, it returns true.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                             *lua53-os.rename*
os.rename (oldname, newname) ~

Renames the file or directory named oldname to newname. If this function
fails, it returns nil, plus a string describing the error and the error code.
Otherwise, it returns true.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          *lua53-os.setlocale*
os.setlocale (locale [, category]) ~

Sets the current locale of the program. locale is a system-dependent string
specifying a locale; category is an optional string describing which category
to change: "all", "collate", "ctype", "monetary", "numeric", or "time"; the
default category is "all". The function returns the name of the new locale, or
nil if the request cannot be honored.
If locale is the empty string, the current locale is set to an
implementation-defined native locale. If locale is the string "C", the current
locale is set to the standard C locale.
When called with nil as the first argument, this function only returns the
name of the current locale for the given category.
This function may be not thread safe because of its reliance on C function
setlocale.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               *lua53-os.time*
os.time ([table]) ~

Returns the current time when called without arguments, or a time representing
the local date and time specified by the given table. This table must have
fields year, month, and day, and may have fields hour (default is 12), min
(default is 0), sec (default is 0), and isdst (default is nil). Other fields
are ignored. For a description of these fields, see the |lua53-os.date|
function.
The values in these fields do not need to be inside their valid ranges. For
instance, if sec is -10, it means -10 seconds from the time specified by the
other fields; if hour is 1000, it means +1000 hours from the time specified by
the other fields.
The returned value is a number, whose meaning depends on your system. In
POSIX, Windows, and some other systems, this number counts the number of
seconds since some given start time (the "epoch"). In other systems, the
meaning is not specified, and the number returned by time can be used only as
an argument to |lua53-os.date| and |lua53-os.difftime|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            *lua53-os.tmpname*
os.tmpname () ~

Returns a string with a file name that can be used for a temporary file. The
file must be explicitly opened before its use and explicitly removed when no
longer needed.
On POSIX systems, this function also creates a file with that name, to avoid
security risks. (Someone else might create the file with wrong permissions in
the time between getting the name and creating the file.) You still have to
open the file to use it and to remove it (even if you do not use it).
When possible, you may prefer to use |lua53-io.tmpfile|, which automatically
removes the file when the program ends.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.10  The Debug Library                                        *lua53-sec6.10*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library provides the functionality of the debug interface
(|lua53-sec4.9|) to Lua programs. You should exert care when using this
library. Several of its functions violate basic assumptions about Lua code
(e.g., that variables local to a function cannot be accessed from outside;
that userdata metatables cannot be changed by Lua code; that Lua programs do
not crash) and therefore can compromise otherwise secure code. Moreover, some
functions in this library may be slow.
All functions in this library are provided inside the debug table. All
functions that operate over a thread have an optional first argument which is
the thread to operate over. The default is always the current thread.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *lua53-debug.debug*
debug.debug () ~

Enters an interactive mode with the user, running each string that the user
enters. Using simple commands and other debug facilities, the user can inspect
global and local variables, change their values, evaluate expressions, and so
on. A line containing only the word cont finishes this function, so that the
caller continues its execution.
Note that commands for debug.debug are not lexically nested within any
function and so have no direct access to local variables.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                         *lua53-debug.gethook*
debug.gethook ([thread]) ~

Returns the current hook settings of the thread, as three values: the current
hook function, the current hook mask, and the current hook count (as set by
the |lua53-debug.sethook| function).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                         *lua53-debug.getinfo*
debug.getinfo ([thread,] f [, what]) ~

Returns a table with information about a function. You can give the function
directly or you can give a number as the value of f, which means the function
running at level f of the call stack of the given thread: level 0 is the
current function (getinfo itself); level 1 is the function that called getinfo
(except for tail calls, which do not count on the stack); and so on. If f is a
number larger than the number of active functions, then getinfo returns nil.
The returned table can contain all the fields returned by |lua53-lua_getinfo|,
with the string what describing which fields to fill in. The default for what
is to get all information available, except the table of valid lines. If
present, the option 'f' adds a field named func with the function itself. If
present, the option 'L' adds a field named activelines with the table of valid
lines.
For instance, the expression debug.getinfo(1,"n").name returns a name for the
current function, if a reasonable name can be found, and the expression
debug.getinfo(print) returns a table with all available information about the
|lua53-print| function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                        *lua53-debug.getlocal*
debug.getlocal ([thread,] f, local) ~

This function returns the name and the value of the local variable with index
local of the function at level f of the stack. This function accesses not only
explicit local variables, but also parameters, temporaries, etc.
The first parameter or local variable has index 1, and so on, following the
order that they are declared in the code, counting only the variables that are
active in the current scope of the function. Negative indices refer to vararg
parameters; -1 is the first vararg parameter. The function returns nil if
there is no variable with the given index, and raises an error when called
with a level out of range. (You can call |lua53-debug.getinfo| to check
whether the level is valid.)
Variable names starting with '(' (open parenthesis) represent variables with
no known names (internal variables such as loop control variables, and
variables from chunks saved without debug information).
The parameter f may also be a function. In that case, getlocal returns only
the name of function parameters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                    *lua53-debug.getmetatable*
debug.getmetatable (value) ~

Returns the metatable of the given value or nil if it does not have a
metatable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                     *lua53-debug.getregistry*
debug.getregistry () ~

Returns the registry table (see |lua53-sec4.5|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                      *lua53-debug.getupvalue*
debug.getupvalue (f, up) ~

This function returns the name and the value of the upvalue with index up of
the function f. The function returns nil if there is no upvalue with the given
index.
Variable names starting with '(' (open parenthesis) represent variables with
no known names (variables from chunks saved without debug information).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                    *lua53-debug.getuservalue*
debug.getuservalue (u) ~

Returns the Lua value associated to u. If u is not a full userdata, returns
nil.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                         *lua53-debug.sethook*
debug.sethook ([thread,] hook, mask [, count]) ~

Sets the given function as a hook. The string mask and the number count
describe when the hook will be called. The string mask may have any
combination of the following characters, with the given meaning:
- 'c': the hook is called every time Lua calls a function;
- 'r': the hook is called every time Lua returns from a function;
- 'l': the hook is called every time Lua enters a new line of code.
Moreover, with a count different from zero, the hook is called also after
every count instructions.
When called without arguments, |lua53-debug.sethook| turns off the hook.
When the hook is called, its first parameter is a string describing the event
that has triggered its call: "call" (or "tail call"), "return", "line", and
"count". For line events, the hook also gets the new line number as its second
parameter. Inside a hook, you can call getinfo with level 2 to get more
information about the running function (level 0 is the getinfo function, and
level 1 is the hook function).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                        *lua53-debug.setlocal*
debug.setlocal ([thread,] level, local, value) ~

This function assigns the value value to the local variable with index local
of the function at level level of the stack. The function returns nil if there
is no local variable with the given index, and raises an error when called
with a level out of range. (You can call getinfo to check whether the level is
valid.) Otherwise, it returns the name of the local variable.
See |lua53-debug.getlocal| for more information about variable indices and
names.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                    *lua53-debug.setmetatable*
debug.setmetatable (value, table) ~

Sets the metatable for the given value to the given table (which can be nil).
Returns value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                      *lua53-debug.setupvalue*
debug.setupvalue (f, up, value) ~

This function assigns the value value to the upvalue with index up of the
function f. The function returns nil if there is no upvalue with the given
index. Otherwise, it returns the name of the upvalue.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                    *lua53-debug.setuservalue*
debug.setuservalue (udata, value) ~

Sets the given value as the Lua value associated to the given udata. udata
must be a full userdata.
Returns udata.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                       *lua53-debug.traceback*
debug.traceback ([thread,] [message [, level]]) ~

If message is present but is neither a string nor nil, this function returns
message without further processing. Otherwise, it returns a string with a
traceback of the call stack. The optional message string is appended at the
beginning of the traceback. An optional level number tells at which level to
start the traceback (default is 1, the function calling traceback).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                       *lua53-debug.upvalueid*
debug.upvalueid (f, n) ~

Returns a unique identifier (as a light userdata) for the upvalue numbered n
from the given function.
These unique identifiers allow a program to check whether different closures
share upvalues. Lua closures that share an upvalue (that is, that access a
same external local variable) will return identical ids for those upvalue
indices.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                     *lua53-debug.upvaluejoin*
debug.upvaluejoin (f1, n1, f2, n2) ~

Make the n1-th upvalue of the Lua closure f1 refer to the n2-th upvalue of the
Lua closure f2.

7.  Lua Standalone                                                *lua53-sec7*
==============================================================================
                                                          *lua53-LUA_INIT_5_3*
                                                              *lua53-LUA_INIT*

Although Lua has been designed as an extension language, to be embedded in a
host C program, it is also frequently used as a standalone language. An
interpreter for Lua as a standalone language, called simply lua, is provided
with the standard distribution. The standalone interpreter includes all
standard libraries, including the debug library. Its usage is:
>
     lua [options] [script [args]]
<
The options are:
- -e stat: executes string stat;
- -l mod: "requires" mod;
- -i: enters interactive mode after running script;
- -v: prints version information;
- -E: ignores environment variables;
- --: stops handling options;
- -: executes stdin as a file and stops handling options.
After handling its options, lua runs the given script. When called without
arguments, lua behaves as lua -v -i when the standard input (stdin) is a
terminal, and as lua - otherwise.
When called without option -E, the interpreter checks for an environment
variable LUA_INIT_5_3 (or LUA_INIT if the versioned name is not defined)
before running any argument. If the variable content has the format @filename,
then lua executes the file. Otherwise, lua executes the string itself.
When called with option -E, besides ignoring LUA_INIT, Lua also ignores the
values of LUA_PATH and LUA_CPATH, setting the values of |lua53-package.path|
and |lua53-package.cpath| with the default paths defined in luaconf.h.
All options are handled in order, except -i and -E. For instance, an
invocation like
>
     $ lua -e'a=1' -e 'print(a)' script.lua
<
will first set a to 1, then print the value of a, and finally run the file
script.lua with no arguments. (Here $ is the shell prompt. Your prompt may be
different.)
Before running any code, lua collects all command-line arguments in a global
table called arg. The script name goes to index 0, the first argument after
the script name goes to index 1, and so on. Any arguments before the script
name (that is, the interpreter name plus its options) go to negative indices.
For instance, in the call
>
     $ lua -la b.lua t1 t2
<
the table is like this:
>
     arg = { [-2] = "lua", [-1] = "-la",
             [0] = "b.lua",
             [1] = "t1", [2] = "t2" }
<
If there is no script in the call, the interpreter name goes to index 0,
followed by the other arguments. For instance, the call
>
     $ lua -e "print(arg[1])"
<
will print "-e". If there is a script, the script is called with parameters
arg[1], ..., arg[#arg]. (Like all chunks in Lua, the script is compiled as a
vararg function.)
In interactive mode, Lua repeatedly prompts and waits for a line. After
reading a line, Lua first try to interpret the line as an expression. If it
succeeds, it prints its value. Otherwise, it interprets the line as a
statement. If you write an incomplete statement, the interpreter waits for its
completion by issuing a different prompt.
If the global variable _PROMPT contains a string, then its value is used as
the prompt. Similarly, if the global variable _PROMPT2 contains a string, its
value is used as the secondary prompt (issued during incomplete statements).
In case of unprotected errors in the script, the interpreter reports the error
to the standard error stream. If the error object is not a string but has a
metamethod __tostring, the interpreter calls this metamethod to produce the
final message. Otherwise, the interpreter converts the error object to a
string and adds a stack traceback to it.
When finishing normally, the interpreter closes its main Lua state (see
|lua53-lua_close|). The script can avoid this step by calling |lua53-os.exit|
to terminate.
To allow the use of Lua as a script interpreter in Unix systems, the
standalone interpreter skips the first line of a chunk if it starts with #.
Therefore, Lua scripts can be made into executable programs by using chmod +x
and the #! form, as in
>
     #!/usr/local/bin/lua
<
(Of course, the location of the Lua interpreter may be different in your
machine. If lua is in your PATH, then
>
     #!/usr/bin/env lua
<
is a more portable solution.)

8.  Incompatibilities with the Previous Version                   *lua53-sec8*
==============================================================================

Here we list the incompatibilities that you may find when moving a program
from Lua 5.2 to Lua 5.3. You can avoid some incompatibilities by compiling Lua
with appropriate options (see file luaconf.h). However, all these
compatibility options will be removed in the future.
Lua versions can always change the C API in ways that do not imply source-code
changes in a program, such as the numeric values for constants or the
implementation of functions as macros. Therefore, you should not assume that
binaries are compatible between different Lua versions. Always recompile
clients of the Lua API when using a new version.
Similarly, Lua versions can always change the internal representation of
precompiled chunks; precompiled chunks are not compatible between different
Lua versions.
The standard paths in the official distribution may change between versions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.1  Changes in the Language                                    *lua53-sec8.1*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The main difference between Lua 5.2 and Lua 5.3 is the introduction of an
  integer subtype for numbers. Although this change should not affect "normal"
  computations, some computations (mainly those that involve some kind of
  overflow) can give different results.
  You can fix these differences by forcing a number to be a float (in Lua 5.2
  all numbers were float), in particular writing constants with an ending .0
  or using x = x + 0.0 to convert a variable. (This recommendation is only for
  a quick fix for an occasional incompatibility; it is not a general guideline
  for good programming. For good programming, use floats where you need floats
  and integers where you need integers.)
- The conversion of a float to a string now adds a .0 suffix to the result if
  it looks like an integer. (For instance, the float 2.0 will be printed as
  2.0, not as 2.) You should always use an explicit format when you need a
  specific format for numbers.
  (Formally this is not an incompatibility, because Lua does not specify how
  numbers are formatted as strings, but some programs assumed a specific
  format.)
- The generational mode for the garbage collector was removed. (It was an
  experimental feature in Lua 5.2.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.2  Changes in the Libraries                                   *lua53-sec8.2*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The bit32 library has been deprecated. It is easy to require a compatible
  external library or, better yet, to replace its functions with appropriate
  bitwise operations. (Keep in mind that bit32 operates on 32-bit integers,
  while the bitwise operators in Lua 5.3 operate on Lua integers, which by
  default have 64 bits.)
- The Table library now respects metamethods for setting and getting elements.
- The |lua53-ipairs| iterator now respects metamethods and its __ipairs
  metamethod has been deprecated.
- Option names in |lua53-io.read| do not have a starting '*' anymore. For
  compatibility, Lua will continue to accept (and ignore) this character.
- The following functions were deprecated in the mathematical library: atan2,
  cosh, sinh, tanh, pow, frexp, and ldexp. You can replace math.pow(x,y) with
  x^y; you can replace math.atan2 with math.atan, which now accepts one or two
  parameters; you can replace math.ldexp(x,exp) with x * 2.0^exp. For the
  other operations, you can either use an external library or implement them
  in Lua.
- The searcher for C loaders used by |lua53-require| changed the way it
  handles versioned names. Now, the version should come after the module name
  (as is usual in most other tools). For compatibility, that searcher still
  tries the old format if it cannot find an open function according to the new
  style. (Lua 5.2 already worked that way, but it did not document the
  change.)
- The call collectgarbage("count") now returns only one result. (You can
  compute that second result from the fractional part of the first result.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.3  Changes in the API                                         *lua53-sec8.3*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Continuation functions now receive as parameters what they needed to get
  through lua_getctx, so lua_getctx has been removed. Adapt your code
  accordingly.
- Function |lua53-lua_dump| has an extra parameter, strip. Use 0 as the value
  of this parameter to get the old behavior.
- Functions to inject/project unsigned integers (lua_pushunsigned,
  lua_tounsigned, lua_tounsignedx, luaL_checkunsigned, luaL_optunsigned) were
  deprecated. Use their signed equivalents with a type cast.
- Macros to project non-default integer types (luaL_checkint, luaL_optint,
  luaL_checklong, luaL_optlong) were deprecated. Use their equivalent over
  |lua53-lua_Integer| with a type cast (or, when possible, use
  |lua53-lua_Integer| in your code).

9.  The Complete Syntax of Lua                                    *lua53-sec9*

Here is the complete syntax of Lua in extended BNF. As usual in extended BNF,
{A} means 0 or more As, and [A] means an optional A. (For operator
precedences, see |lua53-sec3.4.8|; for a description of the terminals Name,
Numeral, and LiteralString, see |lua53-sec3.1|.)
